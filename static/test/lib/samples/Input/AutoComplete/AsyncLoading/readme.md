AutoComplete Async Loading
==========================

The __AutoComplete__ control can load items asysnchronously in the dropdown menu as the input changes. This is useful when the number of items is very large. This sample uses the __AutoComplete's__ __itemsSourceFunction__ property to dynamically load data to the AutoComplete's dropdown. Try typing "ch" or "chi" and waiting a second to see the drop-down.
