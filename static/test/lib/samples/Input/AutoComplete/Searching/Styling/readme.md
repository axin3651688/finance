AutoComplete Styling and String Matches
========================

When searching with the __AutoComplete__, matching strings are highlighted in bold by default. The **wj-autocomplete-match** is applied to matching spans in the drop-down list. If you want to use a different style to highlight matches, use CSS to customize the rules applied to the **wj-autocomplete-match** class.
