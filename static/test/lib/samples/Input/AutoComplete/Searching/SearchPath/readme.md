AutoComplete Search Paths
======================

The **AutoComplete** control searches for matches against the property specified by the **displayMemberPath** property. You can extend the search to other properties by setting the **searchMemberPath** property to a comma-delimited list of properties to search on. This sample is configured to search for _country_ and _continent_ names.
