InputDate Customization
=======================

You can customize the appearance of the **InputDate** and its drop-down calendar using CSS, or using the **Calendar's** **formatItem** event to customize the appearance of specific dates in the drop-down calendar. This sample customizes the weekends and holidays, and uses the **controlTemplate** property to change the **InputDate's** icon from a dropdown arrow to an calendar.
