ListBox/ComboBox Grouping
-------------------------

Grouping is managed by the __CollectionView__ class, but to enable the display of groups in Input contorls, like the __ComboBox__ or __ListBox__, the control's __showGroups__ property must be set to true. This will add group headers tot he dropdown. See sample below for example.
