ComboBox with Objects
=====================

The **ComboBox** can be bound to an object array, but to display the right item in the object, you should set the **displayMemberPath** to the name of the property to display in the **ComboBox's** drop down. This sample displays the values for the **selectedIndex**, **selectedValue**, or **text** properties based on the selected object as user changes selection.
