DropDown Control
========

The DropDown control is an abstract class, used as a base for several controls, including __ComboBox__, __AutoComplete__, and __MultiSelect__. The drop-down element is shown when the dropdown button is clicked or user input changes in the control. This sample demonstrates the behavior with the __ComboBox__ and __InputDate__ controls. There are also options to set some common properties on the __DropDown__ as well.
