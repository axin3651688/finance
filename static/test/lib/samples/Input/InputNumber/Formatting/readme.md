InputNumber Formatting
======================

The **InputNumber** has a **format** property that determines the format of numbers as they are edited in the control.  The syntax of the **format** parameter is similar to the one used in .NET and is [documented here](@api/classes/wijmo.globalize.html#formatnumber).
