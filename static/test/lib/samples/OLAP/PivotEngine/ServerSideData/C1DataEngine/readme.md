Server-side Data - ComponentOne Data Services
=============================================

The **PivotEngine** can connect to the ComponentOne Web API's DataEngine Services. Once the engine is connected to the server, you can build views and display results. This sample shows a **PivotEngine** connected to an AdventureWorks OLAP cube (via C1 WebAPI). You can use the **PivotPanel** to create views and the **PivotGrid** to display the results.


For more details on using **wijmo.olap** with ComponentOne Data Services, plase see [ComponentOne Data Engine WebApi](http://helpcentral.componentone.com/nethelp/C1WebAPI/webframe.html#APIDataEngine.html).
