Microsoft  OLAP Cube
=============================================

The **PivotEngine** can connect directly to Microsoft SSAS OLAP cubes via a URL. This sample connects to the "AdventureWorks" OLAP cube and specifies which fields should be loaded. Specifying fields improves loading time and makes the **PivotPanel** easier to navigate and use. You can use the **PivotPanel** to create views and the **PivotGrid** to display the results.
