PivotEngine
===========

The **PivotEngine** is the main data management class for **wijmo.olap**. It manages the raw data and allows user to build view definitions by configuring fields and field lists. Data summaries can be viewed using the **PivotGrid** and **PivotChart** controls. To start using the **PivotEngine**, bind your data source to the **itemsSource** property. This example shows a **FlexGrid** with raw data and a **PivotGrid** with summarized data from the **PivotEngine**.
