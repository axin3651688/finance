Edit and Persist Views
======================

Views in the **PivotEngine** are defined by the **viewDefinition** property. They are created as user manipulates the field lists of the PivotEngine. You can use the **viewDefinition** property to persist views as an application setting. In this sample, you can select pre-defined views, edit the views with the **PivotPanel** control, and save the view to be loaded later.
