Detail Dialog Customization
===========================

The **PivotGrid** allows you to drill-down into cells to see the data items that were used to calculate each summary. Users can invoke the detail dialog by double-clicking any value cell. You can also invoke the detail dialog by calling the grid's **showDetail** method and passing the coordinates of the cell.
