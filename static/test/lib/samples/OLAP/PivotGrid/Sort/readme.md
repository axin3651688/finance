Sorting in the PivotGrid
========================

The **PivotEngine** automatically sorts Dimension fields when it generates data summaries. It does not sort Measure fields by default. Users may switch the sort direction by clicking the headers on any **PivotGrid** control attached to the engine, when the grid's **allowSorting** property is set to true. The **PivotGrid** control does not show dimension field sort setting by default, but you can set the **showRowFieldSort** property to true if you want that feature.
