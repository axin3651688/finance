OutlineMode
===========

This sample demonstrates the **PivotGrid**'s new **outlineMode** property. In outline mode, the **PivotGrid** renders row fields in an outline format that is more compact and reduces the amount of white space shown on the screen. Outline mode is recommended for views with a large number of row fields.
