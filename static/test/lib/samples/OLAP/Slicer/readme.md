Slicer
======

The **Slicer** control provides a quick way to edit filters applied to **PivotField** objects. It provides buttons the user can click to filter data based on values and indicates the current filtering state, which makes it easy to understand what is shown in filtered **PivotGrid** and **PivotChart** controls.
