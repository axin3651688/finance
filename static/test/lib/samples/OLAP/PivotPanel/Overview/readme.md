PivotPanel
==========

The **PivotPanel** control provides a drag-drop UI for editing a **PivotEngine**'s fields and field lists. You can drag fields among field lists to build views, and use each fields context menu to customize the field properties. Set the **PivotPanel.itemsSource** property to an instance of a **PivotEngine** in order to connect the two components.
