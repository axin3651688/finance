Custom Layout - 2 Columns
=================================

This sample replaces the **PivotPanel**'s default **controlTemplate** with one that uses a CSS Grid-based layout. The layout is a custom layout that breaks up the fields and field lists of the Areas section into 2 columns. Notice how Filters field list is located at the bottom of the first column.
