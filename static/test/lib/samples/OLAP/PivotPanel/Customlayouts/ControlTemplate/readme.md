PivotPanel Layout
=================================

The **PivotPanel** control has a Stacked layout that shows the Fields Section above the Areas Section. This is the default layout used by Excel as well. This sample replaces the **PivotPanel**'s default **controlTemplate** with one that uses a CSS Grid-based layout. This allows you to achieve virtually any layout you want simply by adjusting a few CSS rules.
