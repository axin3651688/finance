Value Fields (Measures)
=======================

The **PivotEngine** has several field collections exposed as properties. **valueFields** contain fields used as "measures", typically numeric values that are summarized by the engine. Use the **PivotPanel**  to drag multiple copies of fields into the **valueFields** collection. When you do that, the panel creates clones that have their own properties. This allows you to summarize fields using different aggregates and calculations.
