Field Formats
=============

The **PivotField.format** property determines how raw values are formatted for display and also for breaking values into groups. This example shows how changing the format property of a dimension fields affects data grouping. If the field format shows the quarter, the data is grouped by quarter. If it shows the month, the data is grouped by month.
