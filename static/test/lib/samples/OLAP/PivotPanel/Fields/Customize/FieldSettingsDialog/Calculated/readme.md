Calculated Fields
=================

Calculated fields are very popular and give a higher level of abstraction from the raw data values. To summarize calculated values instead of raw values, you can add a custom field with the **getValue** property set to a function that calculates the value or the raw item. This sample adds two calculated fields to a **PivotEngine** instance: Range and Conversion.
