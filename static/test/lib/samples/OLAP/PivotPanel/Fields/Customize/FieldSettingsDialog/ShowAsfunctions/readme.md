Field ShowAs
============

The **PivotField.showAs** property allows you to specify common calculations to be performed on the field value before it is displayed. Options for this property are defined by the **ShowAs** enumeration and include differences between the value and the one in the previous row or column, percentages over the row, column, or grand total, and running totals.
