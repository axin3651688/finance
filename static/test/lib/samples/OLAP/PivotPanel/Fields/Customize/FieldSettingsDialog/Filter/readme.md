Edit & Filter Fields in OLAP
===============================

Each field has its own configuration. You can edit fields from the **PivotPanel**'s context menu. Right-click any field on the panel and select the "Field Settings..." option. This will bring up a dialog where you can edit the field's properties, including the filter. You can also do this from the **PivotGrid** on the right.
