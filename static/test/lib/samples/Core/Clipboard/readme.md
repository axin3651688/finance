Clipboard
=========

The **Clipboard** class allows you to customize the behavior of the clipboard by modifying its contents using the static methods **copy** and **paste**. This sample customizes **copy** operations from a __FlexGrid__ by adding column headers to the clipboard content. Try to copy a range from the __FlexGrid__ and paste into an Excel sheet.
