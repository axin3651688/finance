Parsing Dates and Numbers
=========================

To globalize your Wijmo application, include a reference to the appropriate [culture file](@Doc/Topics/Wijmo/Globalization) after loading Wijmo. Dates are parsed using the **Globalize.parseDate** function, and numbers are parsed using the **Globalize.parseFloat** function. This sample uses these methods to shows the formats for some of the supported cultures.
