Formatting Dates and Numbers
============================

To globalize your Wijmo application, include a reference to the appropriate [culture file](@Doc/Topics/Wijmo/Globalization) after loading Wijmo. Dates are formatted using the **Globalize.formatDate** function, and numbers are formatted using the **Globalize.formatNumber** function. This sample uses these methods to shows the formats for some of the supported cultures.
