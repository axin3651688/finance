Tooltips
========

Wijmo also provides __Tooltips__. They appear as popups when hovering over certain elements in the DOM. Use the __Tooltip.setTooltip__ method to associate a tooltip with an element or control on the page. This sample adds tooltips to some texts and a Button with various content in each.
