Tracking Changings in CollectionView
==============================

The __CollectionView__ can help by keeping track of modified items when the __trackChanges__ property is set to _true_. When enabled, the CollectionView updates the **itemsAdded**, **itemsRemoved**, and **itemsEdited** collections as content is edited. This sample displays these collections in separate grids to show how the changes are tracked.
