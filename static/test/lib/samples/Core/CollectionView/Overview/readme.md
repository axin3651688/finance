CollectionView
==============

The __CollectionView__ class is the main data management class used with Wijmo controls. This sample shows how **ICollectionView** works. It creates a **CollectionView** object based on an array with 500 items. The __CollectionView__ is configured to show pages with 10 items each by default. The collection is shown in an HTML table that you can filter, sort, and group, using the controls at the top of each column.
