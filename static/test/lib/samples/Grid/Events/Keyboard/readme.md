Delete Rows with Ctrl+Delete
============================

**Use Fn+Delete on Mac keyboards**. You can handle keyboard events in the FlexGrid by adding HTML event listeners to the grid's **hostElement**. For example, the grid below listens to the 'keydown' event. If you press Ctrl+Delete, it shows a prompt and deletes the current row.
