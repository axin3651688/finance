Editing Events
==============

The FlexGrid has several events related to editing. This example shows how you can use two of them:

*   **beginningEdit**: Prevent editing overdue items by setting the **cancel** parameter to true.
*   **cellEditEnding**: Prevent entering negative amounts for the 'sales' and 'expenses' columns.
