Column Styling
==============

FlexGrid columns have a few properties that affect styling: **cssClass**, **align** and **wordWrap**.  The **cssClass** is the most powerful and flexible of the three properties, but **align** and **wordWrap** are simple and convenient. Also, **align** and **wordWrap** apply to all cells, including headers, while **cssClass** applies only to scrollable cells.
