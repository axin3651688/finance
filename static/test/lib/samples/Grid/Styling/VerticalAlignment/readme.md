Vertical Alignment with Flex Display
====================================

In most cases, the vertical alignment of content within FlexGrid cells doesn't matter, since cells contain only a single row of content. However, in some situations you may want to control the vertical alignment of some or all cells. For example, when showing wrapping text or merging cells vertically.
