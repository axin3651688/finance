Row Height
==========

By default, the grid computes row heights based on the font size and a default cell padding which is set to three pixels in the 'wijmo.css' file. You can change this default easily by specifying a different padding for the cells using CSS. This is a good approach because it applies to cells in all grid panels and does not require any code.
