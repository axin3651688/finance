Row Collections
===============

The FlexGrid control has three sets of rows: **Header Rows**, **Scrollable Rows** and **Footer Rows**. The three row collections are **RowCollection** objects, which extend regular arrays. You may add or remove rows by adding or removing **Row** objects from these arrays. In most cases, however, you won't add or remove scrollable rows, since the grid does that automatically when you set the **itemsSource** property.
