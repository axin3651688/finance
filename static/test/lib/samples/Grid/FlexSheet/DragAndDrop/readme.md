Drag & Drop
===========

FlexSheet supports dragging and dropping the columns or rows into other columns or rows. FlexSheet not only copies or moves the data of the cells, but also copies or moves the style of the cells. When you drag and drop columns/rows without pressing any key, it will move the selected columns or rows into the target columns or rows. When you drag and drop columns/rows with **'Ctrl'** key pressed, it will copy the selected columns or rows into the target columns or rows. When you drag and drop columns/rows with **'Shift'** key pressed, it will change the position of the selected columns or rows with the target columns or rows.
