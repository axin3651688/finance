Cell Merging
============

FlexSheet supports merging the selected cells into one by invoking the **mergeRange** method. If the selected cells contain merged cells, the mergeRange method will un-merge the merged cells. Otherwise, it will merge the selected cells into one cell. FlexSheet allows merging of cells that contain any data. This is different from FlexGrid, which supports content-driven cell merging.
