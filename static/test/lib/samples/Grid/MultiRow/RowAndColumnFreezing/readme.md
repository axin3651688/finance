Row and Column Freezing
=======================

The **MultiRow** control allows you to freeze rows and columns so they remain in view as the user scrolls the grid. Frozen cells can be edited and selected as regular cells, exactly as in Excel and in the **FlexGrid** control. This example allows you to toggle whether the first group of rows and columns should be frozen.
