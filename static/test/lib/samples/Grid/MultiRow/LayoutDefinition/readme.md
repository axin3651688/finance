Layout Definition
===============

The **MultiRow** control extends conventional grid layouts by using multiple rows to represent each data item. The **MultiRow** control extends the **FlexGrid** control, so if you know how to use **FlexGrid**, you will be able to use **MultiRow** in no time. The main new property is **layoutDefinition**, which takes an object that describes the layout of the grid rows and cells.
