Paging
======

The **MultiRow** control supports paging through the **IPagedCollectionView** interface, which is nearly identical to the one in .NET. To enable paging, set the **IPagedCollectionView.pageSize** property to the number of items you want to display on each page, and provide a UI for navigating the pages.
