Styling Records, Groups, and Cells
==================================

In most of the applications, you would want to show where each record and group starts or ends. The **MultiRow** control enables this by adding CSS class names to cell elements in the first and last row/column of each group. The class names are `wj-record-start`, `wj-record-end`, `wj-group-start`, and `wj-group-end`. You can also use the standard **cssClass** property to customize the appearance of specific cells.
