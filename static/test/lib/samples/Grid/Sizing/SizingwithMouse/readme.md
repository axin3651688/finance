Sizing with the Mouse
=====================

By default, the FlexGrid allows users to drag the right edge of the column header cells to resize columns, or to double-click the right egde of the cell to auto-size the columns. You can use the **allowResizing** property to customize this behavior to prevent resizing altogether, or to allow users to resize columns by dragging the right edge of any cells. This last option is especially useful in grids without column headers.
