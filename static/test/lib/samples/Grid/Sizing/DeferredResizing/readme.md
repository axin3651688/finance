Deferred Resizing
=================

By default, the FlexGrid resizes rows and columns as the user drags the mouse. Setting the 'deferResizing' to true causes the grid to show a marker instead, and resize the row or column only when the user releases the mouse button. This may improve performance on grids that have a large number of columns.
