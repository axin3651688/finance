Sorting
=======

The grid supports sorting via the source **CollectionView**. By default, clicking on any column header will sort the data based on the column that was clicked. Clicking the same column header again will revert the sort order. Control-clicking the column header will remove the sort. You may customize the sorting behavior using the grid's **showSort** and **allowSorting** properties.
