Popup Editors
=============

Although the FlexGrid provides efficient, Excel-style editing by default, you may want to customize the editing behavior. This example shows how you can use the grid to display the data and a custom form to edit the items. The custom form is hosted in a Wijmo **Popup** control and contains Wijmo input controls. Click the pencil glyphs in the row headers to edit the item.
