Row Details
===========

Sometimes rows are bound to data objects that contain more information than would fit easily on a regular grid. In these scenarios, you may want to use the **FlexGridDetailProvider** class that is included with the **wijmo.grid.detail** module. The **FlexGridDetailProvider** extends the **FlexGrid** by adding collapse/expand buttons to row headers, and a **createDetailCell** method you can use to provide additional details about an item.
