Popup Column Picker
===================

You can easily implement a column-picker UI using the grid's **columns** property, a **ListBox** control, and Wijmo's **showPopup** and **hidePopup** methods. For example, the grid below starts with an auto-generated set of columns. Click the gear icon at the top-left cell to show a **ListBox** where you can select the columns you want to display.
