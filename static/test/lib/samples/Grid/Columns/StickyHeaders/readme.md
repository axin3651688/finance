Sticky Headers
==============

You can use the **stickyHeaders** property to ensure column headers remain visible when you scroll the document, so the grid is easier to read. Headers in sticky state behave like regular headers. You can click them to sort, drag to reorder or resize columns, etc. See how sticky headers work, scroll the document down until the top of the grid scrolls off the window.
