Column Width
============

This sample shows how you can use XAML-style star sizing to implement flexible layouts with the [FlexGrid](http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.grid.FlexGrid.Class.html). Star sizing is specified in the width property of the [Column](http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.grid.Column.Class.html) object. Star sizing is similar to percentage sizing, except that the values do not have to add up to one hundred. A width of '3*' means 'three times wider than 1*.' The total size used to calculate the layout is the current width of the control minus the width of any non-star columns divided by the number of stars specified.
