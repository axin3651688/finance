Column Collections
==================

The FlexGrid control has two sets of columns: **Fixed Columns** This collection contains the columns on the left of the grid;  and **Scrollable Columns** This collection contains the main set of columns. Both column collections are **ColumnCollection** objects, which extend regular arrays. You may add or remove columns by adding or removing **Column** objects from these arrays.
