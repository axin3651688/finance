CollectionView Paging
=====================

Paging is a common technique for dealing with large collections of data. The **CollectionView** class supports client-side paging by default, so you can generate grids and tables that contain only a reasonable amount of data. To enable paging, set the **pageSize** property and use the **moveToPage** method to select the page you want to display.
