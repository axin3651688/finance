### Server-Side Paging

Server-side paging consists of making requests that bring in one page of data at a time. The actual commands used to retrieve the data depend on the API exposed by the server. Wijmo includes an **ODataCollectionView** class that implements server-based paging (as well as sorting and filtering) for OData data sources.
