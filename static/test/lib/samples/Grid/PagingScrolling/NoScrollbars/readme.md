No Scrollbars
=============

The FlexGrid shows scrollbars automatically, when the width or height of the grid content exceed the grid's visible dimensions.If you want to remove the scrollbars and keep the grid scrollable, you can use CSS to set the **overflow** property of the grid's root element to 'hidden'.
