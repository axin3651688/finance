Aggregates Above the Data
=========================

To show aggregates above the data, follow these steps:

1.  Set the **aggregate** property on the columns that you want to aggregate,
2.  Create a single **GroupDescription** based on a dummy property, and
3.  Optionally freeze the top row to keep the aggregates in view.
