Clipboard Support
=================

The FlexGrid has built-in clipboard support. By default, pressing the ctrl+c or ctrl+Insert keys copies the current selection to the clipboard. Pressing ctrl+v or shift-Insert pastes the clipboard content into the grid. You can customize the clipboard actions using the **copying**, **copied**, **pasting**, **pasted**, **pastingCell**, and **pastedCell** events. Note that the FlexGrid implements an Excel-style 'smart pasting' feature that replicates the clipboard data when pasting. For example, if you select a single cell and press ctrl+c to copy it to the clipboard, then extend the selection and press ctrl+v to paste, the cell will be pasted over the entire selection.
