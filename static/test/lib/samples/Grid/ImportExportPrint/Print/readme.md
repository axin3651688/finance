The printer can also be seen as an export option, especially since most modern browsers allow users to redirect the output to PDF files, cloud storage, etc. The **PrintDocument** class makes it easy to create documents for printing. This sample shows how you can convert a FlexGrid into a **table** element suitable for printing with the **PrintDocument** class.
