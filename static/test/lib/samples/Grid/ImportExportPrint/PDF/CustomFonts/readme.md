Using a Custom Font
===================

This sample shows how custom fonts can be embedded into a document. In this sample, the [Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font family is used and two fonts, **FiraSans-Regular.ttf** and **FiraSans-Bold.ttf**, are embedded into the document. The FiraSans-Bold.ttf font is used to display the header cells, while the FiraSans-Regular.ttf font is used for rest of the content.
