Grouping
========

The grid supports grouping via the source **CollectionView**. Group the data by one or more properties by adding **GroupDescription** objects to the grid's **collectionView.groupDescriptions**. You may also want to hide the columns that are being grouped on in order to avoid showing redundant data.
