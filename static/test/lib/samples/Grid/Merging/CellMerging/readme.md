Cell Merging
============

The FlexGrid supports content-driven cell merging. To enable cell merging, set the **allowMerging** property to indicate what part or parts of the grid you want to merge, and set the **allowMerging** property on specific rows and columns to true. Once you do that, the grid will merges cells that have the same content, grouping the data visually.
