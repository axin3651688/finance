Accordion Trees
===============

Accordions are multi-pane panels that keep only one panel expanded at a time. They are commonly used for navigation. You can use the **TreeView** control to implement accordions. This sample creates an Accordion using the TreeView and CSS by customizing the header display, hiding glyphs and setting **autoCollapse** property to true.
