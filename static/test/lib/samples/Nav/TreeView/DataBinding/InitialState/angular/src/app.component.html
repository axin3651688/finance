    <h2>
        Selecting a default item</h2>
    <p>
        If you select an item when the tree loads, it will
        automatically ensure the selected node is visible,
        expanding the tree and scrolling as needed.
        In this case, we selected the 'Solar Panel' item:</p>
    <wj-tree-view #theTreeSelected [itemsSource]="data" (loadedItems)="onTreeSelectedLoadedItems(theTreeSelected)">
    </wj-tree-view>

    <h2>
        Collapsing to a given Level</h2>
    <p>
        Use the <b>collapseToLevel</b> method to collapse or expand
        the tree to a given level when it loads. For example, the
        trees below start totally collapsed and totally expanded:</p>
    <wj-tree-view #theTreeCollapsed [itemsSource]="data" (loadedItems)="onTreeCollapsedLoadedItems(theTreeCollapsed)">
    </wj-tree-view>
    <wj-tree-view #theTreeExpanded [itemsSource]="data" (loadedItems)="onTreeExpandedLoadedItems(theTreeExpanded)">
    </wj-tree-view>
</div>
