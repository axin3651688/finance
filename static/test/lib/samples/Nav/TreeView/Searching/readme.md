Searching TreeViews
===================

Searching TreeViews is not trivial, and can be implemented in different ways. This sample uses an __AutoComplete__ control as a search box for items in the __TreeView__. The items bound to the __AutoComplete__ control come from a flat array that prefixes the child node strings with the parent node string for search entry in the array.
