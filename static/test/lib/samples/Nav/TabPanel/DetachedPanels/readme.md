Detached Panels
===============

The __TabPanel__ has a built-in panel that shows the content of the selected tab. In some cases, you may want to display the content in a different element. This sample demonstrates hiding the build-in panel and displaying other content when the selection changes (using the **selectedIndexChanged** event).
