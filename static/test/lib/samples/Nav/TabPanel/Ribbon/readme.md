Wijmo Ribbon
============

Wijmo 5 does not include a Ribbon control, but you can create ribbons easily using the **TabPanel** control and the controls in Wijmo's input module.

This example shows how you can build a simple text editor with a custom ribbon.

The ribbon element is a **TabPanel**. The tab pages contain groups of controls arranged in rows and columns. Controls in the groups use [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline), and have tooltips created automatically based on the **aria-label** attribute assigned to each control.

You can toggle the ribbon content visibility by double-clicking the empty area beside the tab headers.
