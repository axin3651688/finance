Gridlines and Tickmarks
=======================

By default, the FlexChart uses horizontal lines to show the x-axis and major gridlines along the y-axis. This makes charts clean and easy-to-read.

You can change this by modifying the **axisX** and **axisY** properties. This example shows how you create and control major and minor gridlines along both axes, and how to customize them using CSS.
