Line Markers
============

The LineMarker class allows you to add a mouse-driven cursor to your charts. The cursor consists of a text element used to display information about the point under the mouse and optional lines to indicate the exact position of the mouse.

You can customize the appearance of the LineMarker using CSS, and its behavior using properties including **content**, **interaction**, and **lines**.
