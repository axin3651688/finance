Trend Lines
===========

The TrendLine class extends the regular Series class to provide a calculated series based on the data and parameters you select.

To add trend lines to a chart, follow these steps:

1.  Create one or more TrendLine objects,
2.  Configure the TrendLine objects as you would a regular series, setting their **binding**, **chartType**, and **style** properties for example, and
3.  Set the TrendLine's **fitType** and **order** properties to determine the type of trend line you want to create.
