Moving Average
==============

The MovingAverage class extends the regular Series class to provide a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.

To add moving averages to a chart, follow these steps:

1.  Create one or more MovingAverage series,
2.  Configure the MovingAverage series as you would regular series, setting their **binding**, **chartType**, and **style** properties for example, and
3.  Set the MovingAverage's **type** and **period** properties to determine the type of moving average you want to create.
