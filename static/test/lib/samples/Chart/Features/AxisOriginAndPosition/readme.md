Axis Origin & Position
========================

By default the FlexChart places the X axis at the bottom of the plot area and the Y axis on the left. This keeps the axes outside the plot area and away from the data.

You can change this default behavior using two properties:

*   **position**: Specifies the position of the axis as None, Left, Top, Right, Bottom, or Auto.
*   **origin**: Specifies the value where the axis crosses its perpendicular axis. If speficied, **origin** takes precendence over **position**.
