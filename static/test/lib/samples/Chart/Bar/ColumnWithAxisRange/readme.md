Column With Axis Range
======================

The FlexChart calculates axis ranges automatically, based on the data being shown. Because of this, in most cases you don't have to worry about setting the axis min, max, majorUnit, or minorUnit properties. In a few cases, however, setting these values explicitly may improve the chart.

The sample shows a column chart with custom Y axis range.
