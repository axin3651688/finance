Bubble Charts
=============

Unlike most other chart types, Bubble Charts display three dimensions of data: X, Y, and size.

To create bubble charts with the FlexChart control, you must set the **binding** property to a comma-delimited list of property names. The first property will be bound to the Y value, and the second to the bubble size.
