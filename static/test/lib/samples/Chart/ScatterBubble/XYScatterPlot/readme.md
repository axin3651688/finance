XY Scatter Plot
======================

The FlexChart's **itemsSource** and **bindingX** properties apply to all series in the chart by default.

Specific series may override those properties and use different data sources and bindings. This allows you to use multiple data sources on the same chart, and reduces the need to pre-process data for charting.
