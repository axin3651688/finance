Custom Function
======================

The **wijmo.chart.analytics** module contains two classes that allow you to plot arbitrary functions without explicitly generating data points:

1.  **YFunctionSeries**: Series based on a function that provides Y values as a function of X values within a given range.
2.  **ParametricFunctionSeries**: Series based on functions that provides X and Y values as a function of domain values within a given range.
