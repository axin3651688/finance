Line Break Chart
==================

A Line Break or Three Line Break chart uses vertical boxes or lines to illustrate the price changes of an asset or market.
Movements are depicted with box colors and styles; movements that continue the trend of the previous box are colored similarly
while movements that trend oppositely are indicated with a different color and/or style. The opposite trend
is only drawn if its value exceeds the extreme value of the previous <i>n</i> number of boxes or lines, which is determined by the
newLineBreaks option.
