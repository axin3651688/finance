Financial Indicators
==================

The sample that includes all indicators in a drop-down (Stochastic, MACD, Williams %R, Relative Strength Index, Average True Range, Commodity Channel Index)

A technical indicator is a set of derived data that is calculated by applying one or more formulas to the original set of data. Technical indicators are generally used to forecast the asset's market direction and generally plotted separately from the original data since the Y-axis scales differ.
