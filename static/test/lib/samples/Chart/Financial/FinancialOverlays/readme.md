Financial Overlays
==================

The sample demonstrates Bollinger bands and envelopes.

Overlays, like technical indicators, are a set of derived data that is calculated by applying one or more formulas to the original set of data. Overlays are generally used to forecast an asset's market direction and generally plotted with the original data set since the the Y-axis scales are the same.
