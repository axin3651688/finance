Heikin-Ashi Chart
==================

Heikin-Ashi charts are a variation of Japanese candlestick charts that were designed to remove noise from candlesticks and behave much like a moving average. These charts can be used to identify trends, potential reversal points, and other technical analysis patterns.
While the appearance of Heikin-Ashi charts are identical to candlestick charts, the underlying price values are calculated based on the formulas.
