Pareto
================

Pareto charts, named after Vilfredo Pareto, contain both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line.

The left vertical axis may contain the frequency of occurrence, cost or any another important unit of measure. The right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences, cost, or total of the particular unit of measure.

Pareto charts help identify the items that account for most of the occurrences so they can be prioritized.
