Radial Gauges
=============

Radial gauges display a metric as a percentage of the length of a circular scale, like a pie or donut chart with a single slice.

By default, the radial scale displays a 180-degree arc. You can change that by adjusting its start and sweep angles. If the **autoScale** property is set to true, the control will automatically scale the gauge to fill the host element taking onto account the **startAngle** and **sweepAngle** properties.
