Thumb Element
=============

The thumb is a circle shown at the end of the 'pointer' range. Use the 'thumbSize' property to set the size of the thumb element.

Linear gauges use the thumb to show the current value as text. In these cases, the minimum size of the thumb is determined by the size of the text element it contains.

By default, the thumb color is determined by the "pointer" color, but you can override that using CSS.
