Radial Gauges with Needle Pointers
==================================

By default, Wijmo's radial gauges use a colored sector and a text element to 
indicate the gauge's current value. This results in a clean and easy-to read look.

If you prefer a more traditional needle-style pointer, you can add an extra
SVG shape to the control and apply a transform to move it when the gauge value 
changes.
