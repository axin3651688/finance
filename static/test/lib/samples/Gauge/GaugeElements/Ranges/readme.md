Ranges
======

In addition to the **face** and **pointer** ranges, gauges may contain additional ranges that show zones within the gauge (like 'bad', 'average', and 'good').

Depending on the setting of the **showRanges** property, these additional ranges may be shown at all times or used to determine the color of the **pointer** range based on the current gauge value.
