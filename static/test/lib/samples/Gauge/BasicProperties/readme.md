Basic Properties
================

The key properties common to all Wijmo gauge classes are: **min**, **max**, and **value**.

The **showText** property is used to show the min/max/value properties as text on the gauge.

Wijmo gauges can also be used as input controls. If you set their **isReadOnly** property to false, users will be able to change the value using the mouse, keyboard, or touch.
