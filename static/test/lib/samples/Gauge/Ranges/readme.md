Ranges
======

Wijmo gauges are composed of **Range** objects. By default, ranges appear as part of the gauge background. This way you can show 'zones' within the gauge, like 'good', 'average', and 'bad' for example.

If you set the gauge's **showRanges** property to false, the additional ranges are not shown. Instead, they are used to automatically set the color of the pointer based on the current gauge value.
