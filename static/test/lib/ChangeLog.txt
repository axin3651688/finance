Build Number 5.20191.603                  Build Date: 04/12/2019
=========================================================================================

* New Features
  - Wijmo npm packages have been moved into the @grapecity scope. From now on 
    any Wijmo module previously available under the wijmo/wijmo.* name should be
    imported using the @grapecity/wijmo.* package name.
    The old non-scoped 'wijmo' package representing the latest Wijmo version is still available
    for the purpose of compatibility and smooth transition to the new scoped packages.
    The current plan is to continue shipping it until 2019v2 release.
    To install all or a specific group of wijmo packages with a single command,
    the special group (*.all) packages can be used:
      all Wijmo:
        > npm install @grapecity/wijmo.all 
      all packages for a specific framework:
        > npm install @grapecity/wijmo.<framework>.all 
        , where <framework> is one of the framework names: angular2, react, vue2,
        webcomponents, angular, knockout
      core pure JS packages only:
        > npm install @grapecity/wijmo.purejs.all 
    Group packages don't contain any code inside them, they only specify package
    dependencies that force npm or yarn to perform flat installation of the real
    packages pertaining to the group.
    If you install a specific package, for example @grapecity/wijmo.input, all
    the packages that it depends on will be installed automatically 
    (e.g. @grapecity/wijmo and @grapecity/wijmo.styles).
    The wijmo/styles folder of the old 'wijmo' package has been moved to a separate 
    @grapecity/wijmo.styles package.
    The wijmo/cultures folder of the old 'wijmo' package has been moved to a separate 
    @grapecity/wijmo.cultures package.

  - Wijmo scoped npm packages (@grapecity/wijmo.*) provide modules in multiple
    formats, with the following entry fields in package.json for different JS version and
    module format combinations:
    "main": ES5 + CommonJS
    "module", "esm5", "wj-esm5": ES5 + ESM
    "esm2015", "es2015", "wj-esm2015": ES2015 + ESM
    "es2015Cjs", "wj-es2015Cjs": ES2015 + CommonJS

  - Wijmo scoped npm packages (@grapecity/wijmo.*) include declaration (d.ts)
    files for multiple TypeScript versions. So Wijmo packages can be utilized in applications
    which use both TS 2.x and TS 3.x versions.

  - Added npm versions of the AngularJS and Knockout interops.

	- [FlexGrid] Added a FlexGrid.errorTip property that allows you to specify a Tooltip 
	  to use when showing validation errors. Use this property to customize the tooltip,
	  or set it to null to restore the original behavior (use the cell's "title"
	  attribute to show validation errors)
	- [FlexGrid] Added an extra parameter to the FlexGrid.getClipString method so it 
	  can export row headers (in addition to column headers). This new feature is 
	  important for exporting the content of PivotGrid controls for example.
	- [FlexGrid] Added a FlexGrid.alternatingRowStep property that allows you to 
	  specify the number of regular rows that should appear between alternating rows
	  (the default is one; set this property to zero to disable alternating rows or
	  set it to a value greater than one to show multiple regular rows between 
	  alternate rows). 
	  Note: The alternatingRowStep property replaces/extends the showAlternatingRows
	  property which has been deprecated.
	- [FlexGrid] Added a FlexGrid.anchorCursor property that allows you to change the
	  grid's behavior when extending selections with the mouse or keyboard to match
	  Excel's behavior.
  - [FlexGrid] Added a FlexGrid.editColumnIndex property that allows you to customize
    the position of the pencil glyph used to show that items are being edited.

	- [GroupPanel] Added a GroupPanel.showDragGlyphs property that causes the control to show
	  drag handle glyphs in the group marker elements.

	- [PivotGrid] Added a PivotGrid.outlineMode property that causes the PivotGrid to 
	  show row groups in outline format, allowing for more compact displays.
	- [PivotGrid] Improved keyboard support in the PivotGrid to allow expanding and 
	  collapsing row groups with the keyboard (use alt-Left to collapse, alt-Right to 
	  expand).
	- [PivotGrid] Changed the olap.PivotGrid to honor the allowMerging property.
	  Also changed the default setting of the property to 'All'.
	- [PivotGrid] Added a PivotGrid.showValueFieldHeaders property that causes the grid 
	  to show headers for value fields even in views that have a single value field.

	- [MultiRow] Added support for the MultiRow.newRowAtTop property (in previous versions
	  the new row template was always displayed at the bottom of the MultiRow.
	- [MultiRow] Added support for explicitly setting the rowspan in MultiRow cells.
	- [MultiRow] Added support for setting the minWidth and maxWidth values in the 
	  layoutDefinition.

	- [FlexChart] Added a Series.tooltipContent property that allows you to add tooltips
	  for specific series.
	- [FlexChart] Added a Series.itemFormatter property that allows to specify an item 
	  formatter function for specific series.
	- [FlexChart] Added support for ranged Area charts: this is similar to the support
	  for ranged Bar and Column charts: specify the name of the properties that contain 
	  the min and max values in the series binding, e.g. myAreaSeries.binding = "ymin,ymax".
	- [FlexChart] Added support for deep binding in series (e.g. series.binding = 'data.sales').
	- [FlexChart] Added support of multiple pie charts. You can specify several comma-separated
	  properties in FlexPie.binding to plot multiple pie charts. 

	- [TreeView] Added a TreeView.expandOnLoad property that determines whether the 
	  TreeView should automatically expand the first node when it loads (default behavior)
	  or if all nodes should be initially collapsed.
	- [TreeView] Added a TreeView.checkOnClick property that allows users to check nodes by
    clicking anywhere on the node header (as opposed to clicking on the checkbox itself).
	- [TreeView] Added a TreeView.checkedMemberPath property that allows you to bind the 
	  checkboxes in the TreeView to data members.

	- [Menu] Added a Menu.closeOnLeave property to work with Menu.openOnHover and provide
	  more control over when menus open and close.

	- [PrintDocument] Added an optional callback to the PrintDocument.print method
	  that gets invoked when the document is done printing.

* Improvements
	- [FlexGrid] Improved the FlexGrid mouse handling logic to prevent sorting columns 
    when clicking column headers that are merged horizontally (because in this case
	  the header refers to multiple columns).
	- Changed the FlexGrid's CSS to use weaker rules for cell styles so they are 
	  easier to override.
	- Improved FlexGrid rendering performance by reordering cells when scrolling
	  horizontally and also when the grid has frozen cells.
	- Improved the FlexGridFilter's date/time condition filtering logic.
	- Improved the FlexGridFilter's condition editor by disabling the value 
	  editors when no condition is set. You can also hide the value editors
	  using a CSS rule like this one:
		  .wj-conditionfilter-editor .wj-control.wj-state-disabled {
  			display: none;
		  }

* Bug fixes
	- [FlexChart] Fixed problem with showing empty series tooltips (TFS 365171).
	- [MultiRow] [Excel] Different behavior for visible property for Exported Excel and
	  MultiRow. (TFS 362721)
	- [MultiRow] [PDF] PDF can't export if any column is not visible. (TFS 362720)
	- [FlexSheet] Cells lost border styles when uploaded. (TFS 349312)
	- [FlexSheet] FlexSheet changes the value of the cell regardless it is readOnly by 
	  autoFill action. (TFS 362256)
	- [FlexSheet] [Filter]  exclusiveValueSearch do not work as expected. (TFS 363101)
	- [FlexGrid] [Export] [PDF] Checkboxes were not exported for GroupRow with child
    elements. (TFS 364690)
	- [FlexChart] Fixed problem with axis layout when using itemFormatter for axis labels (TFS 297650).

* Breaking Changes
  - wijmo-amd-min npm image is no longer shipped in the NpmImages folder of Wijmo 
    download zip. If you still need to use Wijmo from the compatibility 'wijmo' package,
    please use the wijmo-commonjs-min image, or install 'wijmo' from npm.
  - Dist\interop\angular2 folder of Wijmo download zip is not shipped anymore. This
    folder included a version of Angular interop that used Wijmo pure JS modules
    via global namespaces, which lost it's practical sense since Wijmo has been represented
    in CommonJS format in 2016.
  - Dist\interop\vue folder of Wijmo download zip is not shipped anymore. This folder
    contained interop for Vue1, which is of no use now.

Build Number 5.20183.562                  Build Date: 12/24/2018
=========================================================================================

* New Features
	- Added a Tooltip.cssClass property to allow different types of tooltips to use
	  different styles (e.g. information, validation, etc)
	- Improved the ComboBox.selectedValue property to get or set the control's text
	  when it has no itemsSource. This makes it easier to use the ComboBox as a 
	  replacement for regular input elements (and leverage wijmo's infrastructure
	  including styling).
	- Added a new "exclusiveValueSearch" property to the PivotEngine and FlexGridFilter 
	  classes. This new property is set to true by default, which enables an Excel-like 
	  behavior (searching excludes items from the filter). Set it to false to disable 
	  this, so searching only affects which items are displayed on the list, and not 
	  which items are included in the filter.
	- [AngularJS] Added auto-size-rows boolean property to the wj-flex-grid-cell-template
	  directive, which is being set to false disables the default behavior where the cell 
	  template increases grid's default row height to accommodate cells content.
	- Improved the FlexGrid IME handling to start editing on Unicode spaces as well as 
	  regular spaces.

	  bound header row and convert to table. (TFS 355634)
	- [FlexSheet] '01/01/1970' shows in empty cells when import an Excel file, clear Date
	  cells and export to Excel. (TFS 355636)

	  the sheet in Sort dialog. (TFS 355643)

Build Number 5.20182.535                  Build Date: 09/24/2018
=========================================================================================

* New Features
	- Added support for FlexGrid pdf export using WebWorker. See the 
	  PdfWebWorkerClient and PdfWebWorker for the details.
	  The AngularJS PdfExport sample has added WebWorker example to demonstrate
	  the feature.
	- Added a GroupPanel.filter property that allows you to specify the FlexGridFilter 
	  being used on the grid. Once you do that, the group panel will show filter
	  glyphs on the group headers. Clicking the filter glyphs opens the filter editor 
	  for the corresponding column.
	- Added a PivotGrid.detailDialog property that returns a reference to the grid's
	  DetailDialog control used to display detail records when the user double-clicks
	  a cell.
	- Added a repeatButtons property to the Calendar and InputDate controls that 
	  causes the calendar buttons to fire repeatedly while the button is pressed.
	  (This is similar to the InputNumber.repeatButtons property).
	- Added a showYearPicker property to the Calendar and InputDate controls that 
	  causes the calendar to show a list of years when the user clicks the year
	  calendar header.
	- Added a PivotField.getValue property that allows you to specify a custom
	  function to be used for retrieving the field value for a given item.
	  This can be used to implement calculated fields for binning values
	  (e.g. Value => large/medium/small, Country => A/B/C/Other) or
	  any calculated expression (e.g Conversion => sales/downloads).
	- Added a showGroups property to the ListBox and ComboBox controls. 
	  This adds group header elements to lists with grouped item sources.
	  For example: https://jsfiddle.net/Wijmo5/sy7u9rn6/
	  (It is analogous to the showGroups property in the FlexGrid control).
	- Optimized ListBox loading performance (especially in IE/Edge).
	- [FlexSheet] Added option to let user disable dragging cell ranges.
	  Added 'enableDragDrop' property to FlexSheet. (TFS 342191)
	- [FlexSheet] Disable formulas in FlexSheet.  Add 'enableFormulas' property in 
	  FlexSheet. (TFS 341806)
	- Added a new wijmo.olap.Slicer control that provides easy value-based filtering.
	  This is similar to the Slicer control in Excel's PivotTables.
	  For example: https://jsfiddle.net/Wijmo5/3p8rcuqe/
	- Added a new wijmo.olap.PivotField.visible property that allows developers to
	  hide certain fields so they do not appear in PivotPanel controls (and therefore
	  cannot be removed from or moved within the view definition).
	- Added a new CollectionView.sortNullsFirst property. It is set to false by default,
	  which causes null values to appear last on sorted collections, regardless of sort 
	  direction. This is the default behavior in Excel. Setting it to true reverses that
	  behavior and places null values first in the sorted collection.
	- [Enhancement][FlexSheet] Click and Drag Cell Corner to Fill Data. (TFS 229151)

	  properties on several controls.

	  reference in a column in the bound sheet. (TFS 342650)

	  formulas without second argument. (TFS 342218)
	- [FlexSheet] 'Proper' formula only capitalizes the first letter of first word in a 
	  sentence. (TFS 342219)
	- [FlexSheet] Some Math functions: 'Mod' and 'Truncate' and 'Text' function are not 
	  working as expected. (TFS 342566) 
	- [FlexSheet] 'Error: Invalid Criteria' shows in 'CountIf'/'CountIfs' formula cells 
	  when use wildcard characters '*' or '?' for criteria. (TFS 342662)

	- [FlexSheet] Link Between itemsSource and CollectionView Breaks on Sorting. (TFS 341270)
	- [FlexSheet] [IE 11] [Win10] Lag in navigation using arrow key. (TFS 342953)
	- [ReportViewer][PdfViewer] Icons in the toolbar showed incorrectly and both viewers are
	  displayed as same viewer design if 'bootstrap.min.css' is not used. (TFS 324087)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20182.487                  Build Date: 06/27/2018
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
	- Wijmo CSS files are implemented using Sass now.

* Breaking Changes
	- The new Sass-based CSS files contains some rules that are more specific than the
	  original CSS, so if you have custom CSS files you may need to adjust their rules.
	- The new CSS files have more consistent rules about colors, padding, etc, so you 
	  may see some small changes when you upgrade. For example, we made item padding 
	  consistent among ListBox, FlexGrid, Calendar, etc.
	- The new Sass-based theme files are self-contained and do not require you to add 
	  the base wijmo.css file to the page anymore. This means one less HTTP request for
	  pages that contain themed controls. This is not a breaking change, but a chance
	  to improve performance.

* Breaking Changes
	- Changed the default value of the AutoComplete.isContentHtml property from
	  true to false.
	  This should not affect most applications, and the new default
	  prevents involuntary script/html injection.
	  If it does affect your application, set the AutoComplete.isContentHtml 
	  property to true and you will get the original behavior.

* Bug fixes
	- [FlexSheet] Applied formatting/styling cannot retain for correct rows on sorting a 
	  column after apply style to filtered rows and clear filtering. (TFS 215118)

* Improvements
	- Added a wj-state-focus class selector that complements the wj-state-focused selector.
	  The wj-state-focus selector gets the Wijmo control that *has* the focus.
	  The wj-state-focused selector gets *all* Wijmo controls that *contain* the focus.
	  For example, if you have nested Wijmo controls A, B, and C, and control C contains 
	  the active element, then .wj-state-focus will select C and .wj-state-focused will 
	  select A, B, and C. The wj-state-focus selector can be useful for implementing focus
	  outlines in CSS. For example:
        .wj-state-focus,
        a:focus,
        button:not(.wj-btn-default):focus,
        input:not(.wj-form-control):focus,
        input[type=checkbox]:focus {
            box-shadow: 0px 0px 17px 0px rgb(41,173,68);
        }
	- Added React/Redux CryptoCurrencyTracking sample. This is a quite big application
	  implemented using React, Redux and Wijmo for React interop.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20173.406        Build Date: 01/31/2018
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [Olap] Added support for binding PivotEngine components directly to SSAS cubes.
      Previously, binding to SSAS cubes required setting a server and with ComponentOne 
      data engine services which exposed the cubes.
      Now, you can bind the PivotEngine *directly* to the SSAS cubes. For example:
         var ng = new wijmo.olap.PivotEngine({
             itemsSource: {
                 url: 'http://ssrs.componentone.com/OLAP/msmdpump.dll',
                 cube: 'Adventure Works'
             }
         });
    - [Excel] Added support for tables in the FlexSheet control and wijmo.xlsx module.
      The ExcelBook/FlexSheetIntro/FlexSheetExplorer samples have  been updated to 
      demonstrate the new feature.
    - [ReportViewer] Added support for the GrapeCity ActiveReports report generator.
      The PureJS ReportViewer sample has been updated to demonstrate the new feature.
    - [React] Added support for child components representing complex objects for some 
      control properties, for example FlexGridColumn for FlexGrid Column objects and
      FlexChartSeries for Chart Series objects.
      So from now on in addition to the static columns definition like this
        <Wj.FlexGrid 
            autoGenerateColumns={ false }
            columns={[
                { header: 'Country', binding: 'country', width: '*' },
                { header: 'Date', binding: 'date' },
                { header: 'Revenue', binding: 'amount', format: 'n0' },
                { header: 'Active', binding: 'active' }
            ]}
            itemsSource={ this.state.data } />
      you can use the following dynamic definition
        <Wj.FlexGrid 
            itemsSource={this.state.data} >
            <Wj.FlexGridColumn header={this.state.countryHeader} binding="country" width="*" />
            <Wj.FlexGridColumn header="Date" binding="date" />
            <Wj.FlexGridColumn header="Revenue" binding="amount" format="n0" />
            <Wj.FlexGridColumn header="Active" binding="active" />
        </Wj.FlexGrid>
      This improvement makes it possible to dynamically update array property items, for 
      example a set of grid columns, with the 'render' code like this:
                    <Wj.FlexGrid
                        itemsSource={this.state.data}>
                            {this.state.columnsDefinitions.map((colDef) => {
                                return <Wj.FlexGridColumn key={colDef.binding} binding={colDef.binding} />
                            }
                        )}
                    </Wj.FlexGrid>

    - [FlexGrid] Added a Column.multiLine (and Row.multiLine) feature that supports
      multi-line text in cells. Setting multiLine to true causes the cell to honor
      embedded line-break characters (\n) when rendering the cell content.
      Users may enter line breaks by pressing alt+Enter, as in Excel.
    - [Globalize] Added support for escaped characters in date formats, e.g.
      wijmo.Globalize.format(date, '\\h h \\m m'); // h 3 m 55

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20172.358                 Build Date: 09/24/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [Angular/AngularJS] Editing of cells with cell edit templates if forcibly started
      in full edit mode now by default. In full edit mode pressing cursor keys don't finish 
      cell editing, which is important if controls that process cursor keys (like ComboBox)
      are used as cell editors. This is formally a compatibility breaking change, 
      see the "Breaking Changes" section for details.
      You can change this functionality by setting the forceFullEdit property of the
      WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive to false.

* Bug fixes
    - [FlexSheet][FlexSheetExplorer] Error occurs in certain scenario of page navigation.
      (TFS 287662)
    - [Angular/Docs] Added missed WjFlexGridCellTemplate property descriptions.

* Breaking Changes
    - [Angular] Two-way bound properties now update the model asynchronously (like the 
      ng-model directive).
      Before this build, changing the control property updated the model immediately.

      sorting Boolean column. (TFS 286744)
    - [InputDate][Excel] Numeric value is exported incorrectly when export InputDate value 
      to Excel format. (TFS 286761)
    - [FlexSheet] Only checked state (true) is pasted when any data type is cut or copied 
      (TFS 286756)

      be filled with previously typed characters when cell editing begins

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20172.352                 Build Date: 09/12/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Made OData value filter smarter. Now it serializes the lesser of items checked
      or unchecked, which results in shorter URLs and prevents request errors in some
      common scenarios (like un-checking one or two items out of a huge number).
    - Added some configuration properties to the wijmo.olap.PivotEngine class:
        serverTimeOut: the timeout value for retrieving results from the server.
        serverPollInterval: the poll interval for getting progress reports from the server.
        serverMaxDetail: the maximum number of detail records to retrieve from the server.

* Bug fixes
    - [Excel] Large value formatted as string is displayed as exponent value. (TFS 284770)
    - [FlexSheet] 'Square root' formula do not calculate properly when imported Excel file 
      containing 'sqrt' formulas. (TFS 284753)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20172.351                 Build Date: 09/10/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [Angular] Sometimes Wijmo components' normal functionality could lead to the
      ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError exception when Angular runs in 
      development mode. Now all two-way bindings to Wijmo properties are updated 
      asynchronously in the target-to-source direction, which prevents from triggering
      this exception. This behavior change could potentially break some parts of your
      applications, so it can be changed to synchronous binding updates, globally or for
      a specific component. See the "Breaking Changes" section for details.
    - [Angular] Before now, the e.cancel property of the FlexGrid.cellEditEnding event
      was always set to true if a cell editor is implemented as a CellEdit template.
      From now on, this property has a consistent value that reflects actual user's
      action.

* Bug fixes
    - [Excel] Fixed export string issue.
    - [FlexSheet] Script error occurs when copy and paste after cut the cell contents in 
      editor. (TFS 284779)

* Breaking Changes
    - [Angular] Two-way bound properties now update the model asynchronously (like the 
      ngModel directive). Before this build, changing the control property updated the 
      model immediately. Asynchronous updates save your applications from the 
      ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError exception that may be caused by Wijmo 
      components under some specific conditions when Angular runs in development mode. 
      This behavior can be changed back to synchronous updates:
      -- Globally for all Wijmo components, by setting the static WjOptions.asyncBindings
         property to false. For example:
            import { WjOptions } from 'wijmo/wijmo.angular2.directiveBase';
            WjOptions.asyncBindings = false;
      -- For a specific component, by assigning component's asyncBindings property with 
         a false value.
      See the WjOptions.asyncBindings property description for details. The WjOptions
      class is contained in the wijmo.angular2.directiveBase module.

Build Number 5.20172.336                 Build Date: 07/20/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Reduced code size of the Angular, React and Vue2 interops. 
    - [React] Wijmo for React interop can be used now in a project that contains React 
      declaration files (.d.ts). This may be a compatibility breaking change for your 
      React projects that use Wijmo, see the "Breaking Changes" section for details.
    - Added a MultiSelect.showSelectAllCheckbox property to display a "Select All"
      checkbox above the items, so users can select/de-select all items with a single
      click (in addition to the ctrl+A keyboard shortcut that performs the same
      function).
    - Added a MultiSelect.selectAllLabel property to customize the label shown next
      to the "Select All" checkbox displayed when the showSelectAllCheckbox
      property is set to true.

      which should be installed in a project that uses Wijmo for React interop. 
      The declaration files can be installed using the following npm command:
      > npm install @types/react @types/react-dom

      in one line. (TFS 257531)
    - [ReportViewer] Console error occurs when changing the report after setting
      ‘Continuous Page View’ and changing page. (267927)
    - [React] Binding to the itemsSource property is never updated after it has been
      initialized for the first time.
      This fix may potentially cause a regression, see the Breaking Changes topic
      for details.
    - [React] Some control bindings may not update target property values in case where
      there is a binding to an array property defined for the same control.

* Breaking Changes
    - [React] itemsSource property of Wijmo components is updated now each time when 
      React updates component bindings. Because of this, if binding expression returns
      a new array or CollectionView each time it's called, even if it contains the same data 
      (e.g. function getData { return [1, 2, 3]; }), you may get weird effects in some
      controls, and even get a "Stack overflow" exception, because controls detects a different
      data source by comparing references to the current and the new data source instances,
      and refreshes control if references are different.
      You should make sure that binding expression returns the same instance of an array or a
      CollectionView, until a new instance is really required by the application logic.

      in dimension fields. This is similar to the CollectionView's sortComparer property,
      except it applies to pivot dimensions (grid headers) as opposed to measures
      (summary data).
    - Added several new properties to make the Calendar control more customizable:
      formatYearMonth, formatDayHeaders, formatDays, formatYear, and formatMonths.
      All these properties represent format strings used to format different parts
      of the Calendar in month and year view.

* Improvements
    - Improved accessibility by adding ARIA 1.1 built-in support to 
      the following controls:
        - FlexGrid: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#grid
        - TreeView: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree
        - Gauge:    https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#range
        - ListBox:  https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listbox
        - ComboBox: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#combobox
        - Menu:     https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu
    - Added two new properties to improve FlexGrid keyboard accessibility:
        keyActionTab and keyActionEnter
      These properties allow you to customize the behavior of 
      special keys so the grid becomes more accessible or more
      compatible with Excel.
    - Added a new property to improve FlexGrid screen-reader accessibility:
        rowHeaderPath
      If provided, this property specifies the name of a binding to use as
      a provider of 'row header' accessibility values. If not provided, most
      readers will use the content of the first visible column as the row header.

    - Added a new FlexGrid.itemValidator property to improve validation support,
      especially for unbound grids (bound grids can be validated using the 
      CollectionView.getError property which provides the same functionality).
    - [Wijmo5 Mvc][FlexViewer]Internet error displays after running different report
      quickly in "FlexViewerExplorer" sample. (TFS 257523)
    - FlexGrid exports the default border and style of merged cell to xlsx incorrectly.
    - [ReportViewer][PdfViewer] ReportViewer and PdfViewer are partially localized
      when setting Cultures. (TFS 258374)
    - Added support for named ranges in wijmo.xlsx and wijmo.grid.sheet modules.
      The following members were added:
      -- IDefinedName interface and DefinedName class in the wijmo.xlsx module
      -- IWorkbook.definedNames: IDefinedName[]
      -- FlexSheet.definedNames: ObservableCollection (of IDefinedName objects)

* Breaking Changes
    - The default behavior of the Tab key when the FlexGrid has the focus has changed.
      By default, the Tab key cycled through the grid cells (Excel style).
      The new default behavior is to let the browser cycle through the elements on the 
      page (to improve accessibility).
      You can revert to the old behavior by setting the new keyActionTab property to
      wijmo.grid.KeyAction.Cycle.

    - From now on, the name "Angular" in this document denotes Angular 2 or higher, 
      and "AngularJS" denotes Angular 1.x, according to the naming conventions
      described here:
      http://angularjs.blogspot.ru/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html#Naming_guidelines_48

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [Angular 2] Every Wijmo component constructor now calls the special 'created'
      method. If you create a custom component inherited from a Wijmo component,
      and need to perform some initializations in its constructor then instead of
      declaring a constructor you can just override the 'created' method and perform
      initializations in it. This will prevent you from the necessity to maintain
      constructor parameters and keep them in sync with parameters of the base Wijmo
      component. The details of how Angular processes components inheritance can be
      found here: https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/f5c8e09
    - [Angular 2] Samples moved to Angular 2.4.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed TypeScript version number in Angular 2 samples' package.json.

    - Context-menu of FlexSheet cannot be opened by 'Shift+F10' key combination. (TFS 239610)

* Improvements
    - Add mobile support to ReportViewer control.  Added a thresholdWidth property to switch
      mobile or PC UI template.  If width of control is smaller than thresholdWidth, mobile UI will
      be applied.  If width of control is equal or greater than thresholdWidth, PC template
      will be applied.  If thresholdWidth is set to 0, then only PC template is applied and if
      it's set to a large number e.g. 9999, then only mobile template is applied.

Build Number 5.20171.270                 Build Date: 02/16/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Removed deprecated properties 'disabled' and 'required'. These were replaced
      in build 5.20162.192 with 'isDisabled' and 'isRequired', in order to avoid 
      conflicts with standard HTML attributes in the markup.
    - Added gradient color support in chart controls.
      (See FlexChartIntro sample for details).

* Breaking Changes
    - [Angular1/Angular2] An ngModel directive specified on a WjMultiSelect 
      directive/component is now mapped to the 'checkedItems' property, instead
      of the 'selectedValue' property.
      The previously used mapping to the 'selectedValue' property didn't have
      any practical sense, so this change should not hurt your code.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [Angular2] Improved Wijmo components inheritance experience.
      Every Wijmo component/directive now have a corresponding variable exported
      from the component's module that represents its @Component/@Directive decorator
      properties. The name of the variable is constructed as 
      <camel-case component class name>Meta. For example, wjInputNumberMeta variable
      represents metadata of the WjInputNumber component.
      Such a variable is useful when you create a custom component derived from a 
      Wijmo component, where you have to provide a @Component decorator whose properties
      should replicate most of the properties of the base class @Component decorator.
      
      Here's an example of the MyGrid component that inherits from the WjFlexGrid component,
      and adds 'myProperty' property and corresponding 'myPropertyChange' event:
        import { WjFlexGrid, wjFlexGridMeta } from 'wijmo/wijmo.angular2.grid';
        @Component({
            selector: 'my-grid',
            template: wjFlexGridMeta.template,
            inputs: [...wjFlexGridMeta.inputs, 'myProperty'],
            outputs: [...wjFlexGridMeta.outputs, 'myPropertyChange'],
            providers: [
                { provide: 'WjComponent', useExisting: forwardRef(() => MyGrid) },
                ...wjFlexGridMeta.providers
            ]
        })
        export class MyGrid extends WjFlexGrid {
            private _myProperty: string;
            myPropertyChange = new EventEmitter(false);

            constructor( @Inject(ElementRef) elRef: ElementRef,
                @Inject(Injector) injector: Injector,
                @Inject('WjComponent') @SkipSelf() @Optional() parentCmp: any,
                @Inject(ChangeDetectorRef) cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {
                super(elRef, injector, parentCmp, cdRef);
            }

            get myProperty(): string {
                return this._myProperty;
            }
            set myProperty(value: string) {
                if (this._myProperty !== value) {
                    this._myProperty = value;
                    this.myPropertyChange.emit(value);
                }
            }
        }

* Bug fixes
    - Some inconsistent behaviors found for paste operation when any column is copied and 
      pasted. (TFS 237260)
    - Chart is inserted on sheet when 'Enter' key is pressed in Formula bar. (TFS 237217)
    - Script error occurs when importing an Excel file which has no properties. (TFS 230954)
    - Cell selection is jumped when pressing context-menu key. (TFS 229848)
    - JavaScript error occurred when perform paste operation while selecting cell range 
      and mouse click is not released. (TFS 236200)
    - 'Error: Two few parameters' shows when argument text for 'false' is not added in 
      logical formula 'IF'. (TFS 236529)
    - 'Find' and 'Search' formulas do not work and errors show when third parameter is 
      entered. (TFS 238043) 
    - Improved drag/drop to avoid clearing clipboard while dragging in IE11.

Build Number 5.20163.262                 Build Date: 02/03/2017
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.nav module with the TreeView control.
      (See TreeViewIntro sample for details).
    - Added new MultiAutoComplete control to wijmo.input module (See InputIntro sample.) 
    - Added FlexGrid draggingColumnOver and draggingRowOver events to provide
      control over drop targets (e.g. prevent users from moving certain columns
      to certain positions).
    - Improved FlexGridFilter performance when displaying long value lists.
    - Added server-side support for wijmo.olap. To use server-side data providers,
      set the itemsSource property to a URL string pointing to a WebAPI service.

* Bug fixes
    - Date filters did not work correctly with ODataCollectionView when used with
      OData 4 sources (TFS 236203)
    - Extra cells with styles and borders are exported to xlsx format. (TFS 233929)
    - Angular 2: cell templates are not being drawn in a component with OnPush detection
      strategy. See also Breaking Changes.
    - Excel file generated using EPlus does not load in FlexGrid. (TFS 233881)

      column. (TFS 233584)
    - Working with Keys is not as expected for 'Insert Chart'. (TFS 233167)
    - Alphabetical characters in angle brackets "<>" cannot be seen in cell. (TFS 233105)
    - Script error occurs when importing an Excel file which has no properties. (TFS 230954)
    - Cell selection is jumped when pressing context-menu key. (TFS 229848)
    - Unable to import excel file generated from http://mockaroo.com/. (TFS 236285)

* Breaking Changes
    - Angular 2 WjFlexGrid component - added the following constructor parameter:
      @Inject(ChangeDetectorRef) cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef
      This change may affect your code in case if you use custom components derived 
      from WjFlexGrid. You need to add this last constructor parameter to these components 
      if this is the case.

      wijmo.grid.sheet. In addition to existing synchronous load/save methods that work 
      only with JSZip 2, the asynchronous loadAsync/saveAsync methods were added, 
      which require JSZip 3.
      The ExcelImportExport sample is updated to demonstrate the feature.

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGridDetailProvider.isAnimated property to enable animated transitions
      when showing row details.
    - Added a Control.rightToLeft property that determines whether the control is hosted
      in an element with right-to-left layout.
    - Improved showPopup method to handle screen boundaries when reference is a point.
    - Added RTL support to LinearGauge and BulletGraph controls. 
      The gauges now take RTL into account when rendering and handling the keyboard.
      The new behavior is compatible with the input element's when type="range".
    - Wijmo *culture.js files can be loaded before wijmo.js now.

* Bug fixes

* Improvements
    - Added support for Angular 2 Ahead-of-Time compiler. 
      .metadata.json files for Wijmo Angular 2 components are added to NpmImages'
      subfolders.
      Check also Breaking Changes section. 
    - Angular 2 specific properties (like isInitialized) and events 
      (like 'initialized'/valueChangedNg/etc) of Wijmo components are now exposed in 
      class declarations in .d.ts and hence available for IntelliSense.
* Bug fixes
    - The spaces of the text are removed when export FlexGrid to excel.

* Breaking Changes
    - @WjComonent decorator is removed from the library, because AoT compiler
      doesn't support custom decorators.
    - A suffix in implementation names of Angular incarnations of Wijmo events
      has been changed from 'Wj' to 'Ng' (e.g. valueChangedWj became valueChangedNg).
      Note that these events was not officially documented and their direct usage was 
      not presumed.
    - A suffix in implementation names of Angular property change events (intended to
      implement two-way binding) has been changed from 'Ng' to 'PC' 
      (e.g. valueChangeNg became valueChangePC).
      Note that these events was not officially documented and their direct usage was 
      not presumed.

* Improvements
    - Added support for Angular 2.2.
    - Added a getCellElement method to the wijmo.grid.GridPanel class to retrieve the
      HTMLElement that represents a given cell in the panel.
    - Added Menu.show method to display the menu at arbitrary positions on the screen
      (context-menu style).
    - Added a twoDigitYearMax property to the culture calendar so users can control the
      threshold used for converting two-digit year strings into full years.
      e.g. 
            // changing threshold to 2100, so all values are parsed as 20**
            wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.twoDigitYearMax = 2100;
            var dt = wijmo.Globalize.parseDate('30/12', 'yy/MM'); // Dec 2030
    - Added support for showing group *and* column headers in the MultiRow control.
      This is done by setting the collapsedHeaders property to null (rather than true 
      or false).

* Bug fixes
    - Script error occurs on applying font, styles or formatting when there is no cells 
      in the sheet. (TFS 222114)
    - 'Positive number expected' error occurs when insert a chart type in the empty sheet.
      (TFS 222126)
    - Unlike FlexGrid, data values from collapsed group are not shown in the value filter 
      list of filter editor. (TFS 221920)
    - GroupHeader exported with encoded HTML to excel. (TFS 220929)
    - All sheets are selected when opening xlsx file in MS Excel. (TFS 221408)
    - Cell formats change from date to number when add/subtract days in date formulas 
      '=Today()' or '=Now()'. (TFS 222324)
    - Observed multiple issues when setting 'columnCount' and 'rowCount' properties in 
      the sheet containing groups. (TFS 222693)
    - New added value (number/string value cell range) cannot be deleted properly when 
      inserting new columns. (TFS 221776)
    - Script errors occur when delete column/row ranges after insert a chart. (TFS 222078)
    - [FlexSheet][Pdf] Column-header row containing checkbox is exported to Pdf. (TFS 222643)
    - Fixed the issue the formula is updated incorrectly when delete rows\columns in the 
      FlexSheet.
    - Adding the first row with FlexGrid.newItemAtTop moved the new row template to the 
      bottom.

Build Number 5.20163.237                 Build Date: 11/17/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - [FlexGridPdfConverter] added support for FlexSheet.
    - Added support for dataMaps on Boolean FlexGrid columns.
    - Added a dataMap property to the wijmo.grid.filter.ColumnFilter class.
      This dataMap takes precedence over the owner column's DataMap and 
      is used to provide the strings displayed by the filter editors.
      For example, it can be used to change the strings displayed for Boolean
      column filters from 'true/false' to 'yes/no'.
    - Improved FlexGrid performance when binding to large collections and not
      limiting grid height (automatically sized grids). This used to cause
      poor performance since the grid only took its host element into account
      when virtualizing cells; now it also takes into account the browser
      window.

* Bug fixes
    - [MultiRowExplorer] Fixed alignment in PDF export. (TFS 204780)
    - Calendar did not handle min/max on the same month properly (TFS 221061)

* Breaking Changes
    - Added an optional 'fn' parameter that was missing in the wijmo.removeEventListener
      method. This will only break code that called removeEventListener specifying 
      all optional parameters, which should be rare. The change provides more control
      over event removal and consistency with the wijmo.addEventListener method.

* Improvements
    - Added a new wijmo.viewer module that includes two controls:
        -- ReportViewer: displays server-side generated FlexReport and SSRS reports.
        -- PdfViewer: displays PDF files using a server-side service.
      Added ReportViewer and PdfViewer samples to show how to use the new controls.
    - Added ability to skip columns of FlexGrid during exporting to Excel. (TFS 195426)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.222              Build Date: 10/10/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Angular 2 samples in the Wijmo Enterprise Evaluation build now install Wijmo
      modules from an online location (instead of a local one used in the rest of builds).
      A corresponding record in package.json files now looks like this:
      "dependencies": {
          "wijmo": "http://prerelease.componentone.com/wijmo5/npm-images/C1Wijmo-Enterprise-Eval-AMD-5.20162.222.tgz",
          ... another libraries
      }
      Due to this change, the samples from Wijmo Enterprise Evaluation build can be 
      freely moved to a new location now without a necessity to correct Wijmo reference
      in package.json.

* Bug fixes
    - Script error occurs and Excel file cannot be exported when exporting empty pivot 
      view to Excel 'xlsx' format. (TFS 210188)

      unbound sheet. (TFS 210916)
    - Error is observed when navigating to other sample when formula dropdownlist is 
      still opened. (TFS 210924)
    - Charts cannot be inserted into the sheet when select the cell ranges containing 
      different cell count. (TFS 211345) 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.218              Build Date: 10/04/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added external module versions of Wijmo core modules.
      Wijmo download zip now includes NpmImages folder with the wijmo-amd, wijmo-commonjs 
      and wijmo-system subfolders containing Wijmo modules in AMD, CommonJS and System
      formats respectively.
      Each of these folders is effectively an NPM image that can be installed using the
      npm install <path to a folder>
      command. Alternatively, a corresponding record can be added to an application's 
      package.json file that will cause Wijmo installation from a local folder to the
      application's node_modules/wijmo folder, when "npm install" command is executed
      in the application's root folder. For example:
      "dependencies": {
          "wijmo": "../../../../../NpmImages/wijmo-amd",
          ... other libraries
      }

      Currently only Wijmo core and Angular 2 interop modules are represented as 
      external modules in these folders, the rest of interops are shipping as 
      conventional global modules. 
      The culture files (wijmo.culture.<culture_code>) are global modules too, 
      and should be used in conjunction with Wijmo external modules in the same way
      as they are used with global modules - by adding them to HTML page using <script> 
      tag, or in dynamic scenarious by loading them using XMLHttpRequest.

      One important remark regarding Angular 2 interop modules. Those were external
      modules from the day one, and referenced Wijmo core modules via global 'wijmo' 
      variable (e.g. wijmo.grid.FlexGrid). The Angular 2 interop modules under the 
      NpmImages folder are different: they reference Wijmo core external modules
      using the TypeScript "import" statement (that transpiles to the appropriate
      JavaScript code depending on the current module format). For example:
      import * as wjcGrid from 'wijmo/wijmo.grid';

      Module names follow the same convention as Angular 2 interop modules,
      i.e. 'wijmo/' prefix followed by a module name, e.g. 'wijmo/wijmo', 
      'wijmo/wijmo.input', 'wijmo/wijmo.grid'.

      Wijmo Angular 2 samples are reworked to use external versions of Wijmo core modules.
      Their package.json file includes a reference to the NpmImages/wijmo-amd folder 
      (as shown in the example above) that causes an automatic installation of all necessary 
      Wijmo code in the node_modules/wijmo folder when you issues an "npm install" command. 
      Note that this definition works only if you use it from its original location in the
      Wijmo zip image. If you move a sample to a new location then you need to correct 
      this path in the sample's package.json.

      The rest of the samples continue to use conventional global modules.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.216              Build Date: 09/29/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Add word wrap support for saving/loading xlsx file. (TFS 205565)
    - Replaced character-based pencil and asterisk icons used to indicate 
      edit mode/new template in FlexGrid rows with new glyphs: "pencil" and "asterisk".
      This makes it possible to hide or customize the icons using CSS.
    - Added FlexGrid.rowEditStartingStarted events to complement the rowEditEnding/Ended
      events which were already available. Also made rowEditEnding/Ended events fire
      when canceling edits. These changes make it easier to implement custom behaviors
      such as edit mode indicators and deep-binding edit undos.
    - Improved FlexGrid.beginningEdit event parameters to set the "data" event parameter
      to the event that caused the grid to enter edit mode (usually a keyboard or mouse
      event, or null if the editing was initiated by a call to the startEditing event)

* Bug fixes
    - FlexSheet row height of was lost on exporting to Excel. (TFS 205565)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.212              Build Date: 09/26/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added Vue2 interop (wijmo.vue2.js) https://vuejs.org/2016/04/27/announcing-2.0/
    - Added support for wijmo.olap controls to Vue/React interops
    - Added Vue/React versions of the OlapIntro sample
    - Added validation support to CollectionView (CollectionView.getError property)
      and to FlexGrid (FlexGrid.showErrors and FlexGrid.validateEdits properties).
      When showErrors is set to true, the grid shows validation errors on row headers and cells.
      When validateEdits is set to true, the grid remains in edit mode while there are validation errors.

* Breaking Changes
    - Changed the arguments of the cellEditEnding event from CellRangeEventArgs to 
      CellEditEndingEventArgs, which extends the former with a 'stayInEditMode' member.
      Any code that calls the onCellEditEnding event raiser should be updated as follows:
            // raise grid's cellEditEnding event
            //var e = new wijmo.grid.CellRangeEventArgs(grid.cells, this._rng);
            var e = new wijmo.grid.CellEditEndingEventArgs(grid.cells, this._rng);
            grid.onCellEditEnding(e);
    - FlexSheet: Changed .wj-header-row font and background colors.  To get old styles
      reset values to: background-color: #4800ff !important; color: #ff6a00 !important;

* Bug fixes
    - Decimal values show full precision when enter numeric formulas. (TFS 208259)
    - Footer panel cannot be exported to Excel XLSX format. (TFS 208269)
    - Filtering is cleared on entering a formula into a cell in a certain scenario.
      (TFS 208825)
    - Formulae cells were not updated if cell data was set using setCellData method.
      (TFS 208469)

      The following samples was moved to RC.6: 
        InputIntro 
        FlexGridIntro
        FlexSheetExplorer.
      The following samples were reworked for NgModules but still use RC.5:
        FlexChartIntro
        FlexPieIntro
        CollectionViewIntro
        CellTemplateIntro
        FinancialChartIntro

* Improvements
    - Improved keyboard support in wijmo.Menu. Now users can use the keyboard to open 
      the menu with (Enter/f4/alt+up/alt+down) and to navigate the options (up/down/
      autosearch).
    - Angular 2: added support for NgModule system introduced in RC.5. Each Wijmo
      Ng2 module includes corresponding NgModule that represents the module in Ng2
      application and exports all its components. NgModule's name is inferred from
      ES6 module name, e.g. for ES6 module wijmo/wijmo.angular2.grid.filter
      the name of corresponding NgModule is WjGridFilterModule.
      Only few samples are reworked so far to use NgModel: InputIntro, FlexGridIntro,
      ngForms and FlexSheetExplorer. The latter is SPA application that implements
      lazy modules loading.

* Bug fixes
    - Searching is not working correctly at second time in filter by value editor. 
      (TFS 204947)
    - Excel file is corrupted when export MultiRow after add a new row containing 'NaN' 
      cells. (TFS 204946)
    - Conditional filtering without setting filter value does not work properly in unbound
      sheet. (TFS 204380)
    - Group header cells cannot be entered into editing mode in FlexSheet. (TFS 205648)

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Angular 1/2: added support for cell templates for FlexGrid column footers.
      WjFlexGridCellTemplate.cellType property now accepts 'ColumnFooter' and 'BottomLeft'
      to be applied to the corresponding cell types.
      In order to get a cell value in 'ColumnFooter' cell templates the $value (Angular 1)
      or cell.value (Angular 2) properties can be used.
    - Added a Gauge.showTicks property that causes linear and radial gauges to show
      tick marks on the gauge face. The tick marks start from "min" to "max" at every "step".
      By default, the tick marks are white and 2 pixels in thickness. They can be styled 
      using a ".wj-gauge .wj-ticks" CSS selector to customize their "stroke" and "stroke-width"
      values.
    - The FlexGridPdfConverter class now supports MultiRow. (TFS 204780)

* Bug fixes
    - FlexSheet does not handle the clipboard properly. (TFS 204530)
    - Aggregate cells from group header rows cannot be deleted by pressing 'Delete' 
      key. (TFS 200935)
    - Filter values list shows merged cell contents unlike MS-Excel. (TFS 199443)
    - Filtering remains applying in old column when drag and drop filtered column to new 
      position. (TFS 200934)
    - Currency and Percentage format of the Cell in MultiRow control cannot be exported 
      correctly to Excel format. (TFS 204796)
    - Filtering is not retained when unfreeze the frozen pane. (TFS 204887)
    - When Culture is set to Japanese, date and currency columns are not exported correctly
      to Excel format. (TFS 204797)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.201              Build Date: 08/23/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support for column footers panel on the FlexGrid.
      Column footers have their own 'columnFooters' grid panel (similar to columnHeaders 
      and rowHeaders). To add column footers to a grid, add one or more rows to its
      columnFooters panel. For example:
        grid.columnFooters.rows.push(new wijmo.grid.GroupRow())
      In this example, we added a GroupRow, which will cause the grid to automatically
      display the aggregates set in each Column.
      Alternatively, you could add on or more regular rows, and set the cell contents of 
      those row using the columnFooters.setCellData method:
        grid.columnFooters.rows.push(new wijmo.grid.Row());
        grid.columnFooters.setCellData(0, 0, 'column footer value');

* Bug fixes
    - Alphabetic characters cannot be entered in date and numeric columns after imported an 
      Excel file. (TFS 204082)
    - Filter by value is not working correctly when filter by value twice in the same 
      column. (TFS 204339)
    - FlexSheet cross-sheet formulas don't update in other sheets when value is changed. 
      Only update when the cell containing the formula is double-clicked. (TFS 203786)
    - Console error occurs and filter editor cannot be opened when the sheet is frozen.
      (TFS 204376)
    - Error occurs on opening filter editor after load an empty Excel file into the 
      FlexSheet. (TFS 204385)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20162.200              Build Date: 08/18/2016

    - Improved the layout of the on-line help system.
    - Added a new interop module for React: wijmo.react.js.
    - Added a new interop module for Vue: wijmo.vue.js.
    - Added a new FlexGrid.newRowAtTop property to control whether the new row template
      should be displayed at the top or at the bottom of the data rows.
    - Improved FlexGrid scrolling with frozen cells (used to be a little jerky in IE).
    - Improved performance of Row/Col.IsSelected method.
    - Improved performance of FlexGrid.preserveOutlineState property.
    - Added an optional 'dataItem' parameter to the DataMap.getDisplayValues method.
      The dataItem can be used to restrict the list of display values based on properties
      of the data item being rendered/edited (see http://wijmo.com/topic/flexgrid-datamap-that-is-row-dependent/).
    - Angular 2 - added the autoSizeRows boolean property to the wjFlexGridCellTemplate
      directive that allows to disable automatic row height expansion.
    - Added support for "deep-binding" to the ListBox control (e.g. "customer.name").
    - Add a new charting control: FlexRadar for creating radar and polar charts. 
      The control is in new module: wijmo.chart.radar.js.
      FlexRadarIntro samples (PureJs, Angular 1/2) are added to demonstrate the new
      control's features.

* Bug fixes
    - Filter editor does not open and console error occurs after load an Excel file which 
      contains hidden rows and columns. (TFS 201600)
    - The 'collapsed' state of the row is wrong after exporting to xlsx file. 
    - Angular 1/2 - a cell of a hierarchical FlexGrid (with childItemsPath defined) can't
      be edited if a cell template is applied to the cell.
    - Angular 2 - fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows/autoSizeColumns methods with
      templated cells.

* Improvements
    - Angular 2: added support for Angular forms. The ngForms sample demonstrates the 
      feature.
      The implementation is based on the *new* forms implementation from the @angular/forms 
      module, instead of *deprecated* forms stuff from the @angular/common module – 
      see the documentation on the new forms stuff here: 
      https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html .
      The dynamic forms scenario described here
      https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dynamic-form.html
      is supported as well. The ngForms sample includes the modified
      version of the abovementioned Dynamic Forms example that uses
      Wijmo input components.
    - Angular 2: tested against RC.4.
    - Added a few class names to FlexGrid elements to enable more flexible CSS-based
      styling. The new class names are:
        wj-elem-collapse  Element that holds the expand/collapse glyphs in group rows
        wj-elem-dropdown  Element that holds the drop-down glyph in data-mapped cells
        wj-elem-filter    Element that holds the filter glyph in column headers
    - Added a "wj-autocomplete-match" class to define the default style used for 
      highlighting AutoComplete matches (can be overridden by the cssClass property).
    - Added an AutoComplete.searchMemberPath property that allows you to specify 
      item properties to use when searching (in addition to displayMemberPath).
    - Added an 'isReadOnly' property to all input controls (DropDown, InputNumber, Calendar).
      This prevents users from changing the value, but still allows selection, focus, and events.
      It is equivalent to the 'readonly' property in HTML input elements, but also prevents
      editing with the mouse (drop-downs, buttons, wheel).
    - Added a selectionMode property to the InputDate and Calendar controls to allow 
      selecting months rather than specific days.
    - Added specific class names to derived controls (for example, the ComboBox control host
      element now has class wj-combobox in addition to wj-control and wj-dropdown).
    - Improved CSS to keep InputDate calendar width constant as the user navigates months
      in IE.
    - Made input controls switch the 'for' attribute of labels targeting the host element 
      so they target the inner input element instead. For example:
          <label for="inputDate">Departure:</label>
          <wj-input-date id="inputDate"></wj-input-date>
      The InputDate will automatically set the id to its inner input element to 'inputDate.input'
      and will switch the "for" attribute of the label to target the input element instead.
    - Added undo/redo processing for inserting/removing chart in FlexSheet. (TFS 191085)
    - Added a new 'wj-state-empty' class to controls that contains empty input elements.
      This class can be used in CSS selectors along with the wj-state-focused class.
    - Allow empty strings on masked inputs when "isRequired" is false.

* Breaking changes
    - Replaced some custom attributes used by the FlexGrid control with class names 
      for better W3C compliance and CSS support:
        "wj-collapse" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-collapse" class name
        "wj-dropdown" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-dropdown" class name
        "wj-filter" attribute was replaced with "wj-elem-filter" class name
      This change may affect applications that customize the display of node cells.
      For example, you should replace:
        cell.innerHTML = '<span wj-collapse class="glyphicon ...
      With
        cell.innerHTML = '<span class="wj-elem-collapse glyphicon ...
    - Deprecated 'disabled' and 'required' properties on all controls and replaced them
      with 'isDisabled' and 'isRequired'. This avoids conflicts with HTML attributes
      in markup. The old properties still work, but will be removed in a future release,
      so this is not a breaking change yet, but will be.

* Bug fixes
    - 'Year Quarter' and 'Fiscal Year Quarter' formats cannot be exported correctly to XLSX 
      file. (TFS 197681)

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.chart.hierarchical.Sunburst control. The control displays hierarhical 
      data as multi-level pie charts.
    - Added wijmo.chart.analytics.Waterfall class. The Waterfall series represents data
      values with cumulative effects(Waterfall chart).
    - wijmo.pdf - added support for drawing SVG images (the PdfPageArea.drawSvg method).
    - Added customized filter for FlexSheet, make the filtering behave exactly like in Excel.
    - Updated the cell ranges processing in formula that Insert/delete row/column will update 
      affected cell ranges in formulas.
    - Added a CollectionView.sortComparer property to support using custom value 
      comparers such as Dave Koele's "natural sorting": http://www.davekoelle.com/alphanum.html
    - Added JavaScript IntelliSense support, see the IntelliSense folder in Wijmo zip.
    - Angular 2 - adapted to Angular 2 RC.3
    - Angular 2: the 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property are added
      to all components. The event triggers when the bindings on the component and all
      its child components have been initialized, and the property changes its value
      from false to true at this moment.
      Note that 'isInitialized' is a dynamic property, in a sense is that it's not 
      exposed as a TypeScript property out of the component interface, so it should be
      read using the component['isInitialized'] syntax.

* Bug fixes
    - When undo the current cell in editing mode with 'Ctrl + Z', original value is not 
      restored in editing cell. (TFS 189582)

      range. (TFS 197166)
    - Undo/redo action cannot be done at once after Inserting/deleting rows/columns like 
      MS-Excel. (TFS 197005)
    - Sheets navigation is not working correctly in IE and FireFox when there is many 
      sheets and direction of the FlexSheet is Right To Left. (TFS 192724)

* Breaking changes
    - The CollectionView.moveCurrentToPrevious method used to allow moving the cursor to
      position -1. Now it stops moving when the cursor reaches the first item (position zero).
      This was done for two reasons:
      1) To make the method more convenient to use in typical first/prev/next/last VCR-style 
         navigation buttons (the 'prev' button can now be linked to moveCurrentToPrevious 
         without any additional tests), and
      2) To improve consistency with the moveCurrentToNext method, which stopped at the last 
         item in the collection.

* Improvements
    - Improved keyboard/focus handling in Popup control (TFS 148651)
    - Improved the FlexGridFilter value filters to behave more like Excel (TFS 133354)
      The values shown for a column include only items that are not excluded by other filters. 
      For example, if you filter a list by 'name' and that results in two items being shown, 
      other field filters will only show the values of those two items.
    - Added new settings to AllowResizing enum to allow resizing rows and columns by
      dragging the edges of scrollable (non-header) cells. This is especially useful when
      headers are hidden (see headersVisibility). The updated settings are
        export enum AllowResizing {
            None
            Columns,
            Rows,
            Both,
            ColumnsAllCells, // resize columns by dragging cell edges
            RowsAllCells,	 // resize rows by dragging cell edges
            BothAllCells	 // resize rows and columns by dragging cell edges

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.angular2.* modules (Beta version), that allow to use Wijmo 
      controls in Angular 2 applications markup.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.animation module with the ChartAnimation main class that
      provides animations for the FlexChart, FlexPie and FinancialChart controls.
      The FlexChartAnimation sample demonstrates module's features.
    - Added ChartGestures to the wijmo.chart.interaction module. The class adds 
      touch zoom and panning functionality to the FlexChart control.
      The FlexChartZoom sample demonstrates usage of the class. 
    - Added FlexChartBase.exportToImage method that allows exporting charts to 
      PNG, JPEG, and SVG formats.
    - Added Axis.labelPadding property that controls padding of axis labels.
    - Added a wijmo.olap module that provides Excel-like pivot tables and charts
      to Wijmo.
    - Added a wijmo.pdf module, with the PdfDocument main class that provides client
      side functionality for creating files in PDF format. The module is based on a 
      modified version of the PDFKit library (http://pdfkit.org/) with a footprint
      minified up to 375Kb.
    - Added wijmo.grid.pdf module which is an extension of the wijmo.pdf and
      wijmo.grid modules and provides functionality for exporting FlexGrid to
      PDF format.
    - Added a PrintDocument class to the wijmo module. This class allows you to create
      documents for printing, which in modern browsers includes the option to export
      to PDF.
    - Modified FlexGridFilter module to clear value filters when all possible values 
      are selected.
    - Added a FlexGrid.preserveSelectedState property to control whether the grid
      should preserve the selected state of rows when the data is refreshed.
    - Added a FlexGrid.preserveOutlineState property to control whether the grid
      should preserve the collapsed/expanded state of group rows when the data is 
      refreshed.
    - Added a Tooltip.showAtMouse property that causes the tooltip position to be
      computed based on the mouse position rather than on the target element.

=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a wijmo.input.DropDown.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
      the drop-down elements of the controls (this applies to all controls that extend
      DropDown, including ComboBox, MultiSelect, InputDate, InputTime, etc).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.112              Build Date: 01/16/2016
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a new InputDateTime control to enter/edit date and time values using a
      single control (as opposed to using an InputDate and an InputTime).
    - Added a new FlexGrid.imeEnbled property to support IME modes while the grid
      is not in edit mode. This property benefits sites and applications in Japanese,
      Chinese, Korean and other languages that require IME support.
    - Improved FlexGrid.focus() implementation to prevent the browser from scrolling 
      the grid's hostElement into view when the grid gets the focus.
    - Improved allowAddNew to work better with childItemsPath.
    - Improved IE9 polyfill to support drag/drop in modal dialogs (TFS 140812)
    - Added Angular 2 Explorer sample with components for core Wijmo controls. The 
      sample uses Beta.1 version of Angular 2.
    - wijmo.xlsx
        -- Added support for several new functions:
            Column
            Columns
            COUNTA
            COUNTBLANK

        -- Added support for importing shared formulas.
        -- Improved performance.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet 
        -- Added support for user-provided custom functions, see the 
           FlexSheet.addCustomFunction method.
        -- Added FlexSheet.unknownFunction event that allows to process
           non-supported functions found in cell expressions.
        -- Added Sheet.itemsSource property that allows to change the items
           source for data bound sheets.
    - Added a wijmo.input.DropDown.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
      the drop-down elements of the controls (this applies to all controls that extend
      DropDown, including ComboBox, MultiSelect, InputDate, InputTime, etc).
    - Added a wijmo.grid.Column.dropDownCssClass property to make it easier to style
      the drop-down list used to edit cells in columns that have dataMaps.
    - Added a wijmo.collections.CollectionView.useStableSort property that causes the
      CollectionView class to use a stable sort algorithm which is 30 to 50% slower
      than the native sort but maintains the relative order of records with equal keys.

* Breaking changes
    - The wijmo.xlsx.XlsxConverter class is deprecated. Use the wijmo.xlsx.Workbook
      class instead. XlsxConverter is still supported for compatibility and will be
      eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx.FlexGridXlsxConverter class:
        -- the 'export', 'toWorkbookOM', 'import' and 'fromWorkbookOM' methods are deprecated.
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
    - wijmo.grid.sheet.FlexSheet class:
        -- saveToWorkbookOM and loadFromWorkbookOM methods are deprecated. 
           Use the 'save' and 'load' methods instead. The old methods are still supported for 
           compatibility and will be eliminated in the future releases.
    - CellRangeEventArgs class: removed property "cellRange", which was deprecated 
      in build 105 and replaced by "range".
    - HitTestInfo class: removed property "gridPanel", which was deprecated 
      in build 105 and replaced by "panel".

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed grid to to include all items and sub-items in aggregates (TFS 139570,
      partially fixed earlier in build 5.20143.35)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.109              Build Date: 12/10/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved CollectionView.trackChanges to allow tracking of changes made to items
      that are not the current edit item. The most common scenario is pasting blocks
      of data into a FlexGrid.
    - Improved FlexGrid.childItemsPath property to accept arrays of strings in case
      items at different levels use different property names for their child items.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.108              Build Date: 12/06/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Changed the default value of the InputTime.step property to 15 (which seems
      to be the most common/useful setting). This causes the control to display
      the drop-down button by default; to remove the button, set the step property
      to null.
    - Added support for opening FlexGrid.dataMap dropdowns using the keyboard
      (F4, alt+up/down, like WinForms and WPF/Excel) (TFS 124408)
    - Improved the Control.dispose method to remove all Wijmo event listeners from the control
      being disposed (dispose also removes all HTML event listeners added with the 
      Control.addEventListener method).
    - Added a DropDown.autoExpandSelection property that determines whether input 
      controls should automatically select whole words/numbers when clicked.
      This applies to all controls that derive from DropDown, and makes it easier
      to edit dates, times, colors, etc.
    - Added a ComboBox.headerPath property that allows decoupling the values shown in
      the combo's input element from the values shown in the drop-down list.
    - Improved Globalize to support formatting of fiscal years and quarters with the 
      following format specifiers:
        - 'EEEE': government fiscal year
        - 'eeee': corporations fiscal year
        - 'U': government fiscal quarter
        - 'u': corporations fiscal quarter
      The conversion from calendar to fiscal date is culture-dependent. If you are 
      not using the appropriate culture file (and don't want to), then you can 
      specify the conversion factor by setting the 
      wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffset variable to an array
      containing two integers that represent the offset (in months) of the start of 
      the fiscal year for government and for the private sector.
      For example, the Japanese culture uses a three month offset for the government's
      fiscal year and no offset for the private sector:
          wijmo.culture.Globalize.calendar.fiscalYearOffsets = [3, 0];
    - Added five new glyphs to wijmo.css:
        wj-glyph-step-forward
        wj-glyph-step-backward
        wj-glyph-file
        wj-glyph-calendar
        wj-glyph-clock
    - Added automatic label rotation for FlexChart category x-axis. The labels are 
      rotated to avoid overlapping if axis.labelAngle is not specified.	
    - Used IntelliSpell to spell-check all the documentation.
    - The FlexGridXlsxConverter class now supports row headers export. The behavior
      is controlled by the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions.includeRowHeaders property.

* Breaking changes
    - wijmo.grid.xlsx module, the IFlexGridXlsxExportOptions interface:
        - 'needGetCellStyle' property has been renamed to 'includeCellStyles'. 
        - 'includeColumnHeader' property has been renamed to 'includeColumnHeaders' (ending 's'). 
      The old property names have been deprecated and will be removed in future builds.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20153.105              Build Date: 11/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved InputMask handling of delete key with masks that contain numbers in the
      template (e.g. "99-55-9999", TFS 136087).
    - Add minScale/maxScale to RangeSelector extension for controlling the valid range.
    - Added FlexGrid.selectedRows and selectedItems properties. Both can be used to get
      a list with the currently selected rows or their associated data items. When the
      selectionMode property is set to ListBox, they can also be used to set the selected 
      rows or data items.
    - Refactored wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGrid filter by removing the OData-specific 
      getODataFilterDefinition method and replacing it with a call to the collection
      view's updateFilterDefinition method; which if present updates the filter definition
      used on the server-side. This refactoring allows other CollectionView implementations
      (such as BreezeCollectionView) to support server-side filtering.
    - Improved BreezeCollectionView sample to show server-side filtering (TFS 129832).
    - Added support for Japanese characters (IME, Katakana, Hiragana) in InputMask control.
    - Added a FlexGrid.showAlternatingRows property to allow disabling alternate row
      styling without changing any CSS rules.
    - Added a FlexGrid.updatedView event that fires when the grid finishes creating/updating 
      the cell elements for the current view (e.g. after binding, refreshing, resizing, 
      scrolling, etc.)

* Bug fixes
    - InputDate control did not preserve the time part of the value being edited.

    - Improved wijmo.grid.filter.FlexGridFilter to allow filtering with merged headers.
    - Improved auto-generated column headers.
      (we now capitalize first letter, break up camel-case binding strings, so the header
      for a column bound to the 'productName' property becomes 'Product Name' be default).
    - Optimized wijmo.closest method to use 'matches' method instead of 'querySelectorAll'.
    - Improved InputNumber control behavior on mobile devices.

* Improvements
    - Added FlexGrid.pastingCell/pastedCell events. These events fire while the grid 
      is pasting data into individual cells. Previously, the grid would fire editing
      events in these situations, but that led to some ambiguities that affected the
      implementation of custom editors.

Build Number 5.20152.85              Build Date: 09/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved Angular FlexGrid.CellEdit template to use the character that was typed
      when initiating the edits (as the built-in editors do).
    - Added a wijmo.odata.ODataVirtualCollectionView class that loads data on demand.
      See the VirtualData sample for details.
    - ODataCollectionView.filterDefinition property is applied to filter on the server
      even when filterOnServer is set to false. This allows applications to apply 
      server and client-side filtering to the same collection.
    - Made FlexGrid.cellFactory property get/set.
    - Added a wijmo.grid.DataMap.isEditable property to allow users to enter data that
      is not on the DataMap (mapped items become non-exclusive options).

      of the original index of the item that was removed.
    - FlexGrid MergeManager did not always behave consistently when merging ranges that
      included both row and column merging (TFS 129001)

* Breaking changes
    - Wijmo directives for AngularJS no longer update controller properties bound to 
      by-ref ('=') properties that logically suppose one-way binding.


=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20152.84              Build Date: 08/27/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.showMarquee property that determines whether the grid should display
      an Excel-style marquee around the current selection. The marquee may be styled using
      the "wj-marquee" class selector.
    - Added a FlexGrid.showSelectedHeaders property that determines whether the grid should 
      add a "wj-state-multi-selected" class selector to row and/or column header elements;
      these can be used in CSS to highlight header cells that correspond to the current selection.
    - Added a new 'clip' parameter to the FlexGrid.getMergedRange method; if true (the default), 
      the method clips the merged range to the current view range.
      The 'clip' parameter has no effect on grid; it was added to facilitate the development 
      of export utilities, which may need to get merged ranges that are not clipped to the 
      grid's current view range.
    - Added Calendar.itemValidator and InputDate.itemValidator properties to enable preventing
      certain days from being selected.
    - Added a Calendar.formatItem event to complement the Calendar.itemFormatter property.
    - LinearGauge now accounts for thumbSize when dimensioning the gauge's face.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved touch support in editable Gauges.
    - Fixed problem with chart type initialization in constructor parameter(TFS 125747).
    - Pie chart labels displayed correctly when it's position = 'Outside'(TFS 125423).
    - Chart does not change color's alpha if it was specified as rgba in palette (TFS 119543).

* Breaking changes

    - We made a small change to the logic that assigns classes to FlexGrid cells. Before, we 
      removed the wj-group class from selected cells. That is no longer the case. There are 
      two reasons for this change:

      1) Correctness. Group cells remain group cells even when they are selected. Keeping the
         wj-group class allows you to use CSS to style grouped and selected cells independently.
      2) Performance. The new code is (very slightly) more efficient.

      This change could break your custom FlexGrid CSS. If you have CSS rules that affect group 
      colors they should be modified to exclude selected cells. In other words, if you had a 
      rule like this:

        .wj-group {
            background: green;
        }

      You should change it to this:

        .wj-group:not(.wj-state-selected):not(.wj-state-multi-selected) {
            background: green;
        }

Build Number 5.20152.76              Build Date: 08/13/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a new 'wj-state-focused' class to controls that contains the focus. This 
      class is toggled automatically to reflect the control's focus state and can be 
      used in CSS selectors to add focus-related styles to parts of focused controls,
      such as gauge cursors, chart series, and grid ranges.
    - Added Angular attributes for chart series axisX and axisY (TFS 122055).
    - Added wijmo.input.DropDown.isDroppedDownChanging event to allow for customization
      of the drop-down before it is shown.
    - Added wijmo.grid.filter.ValueFiler.uniqueValues property to specify the list of values 
      to be shown on the list, which is more efficient than building the list from the data
      and works on collections that are filtered on the server.
    - Improved features and performance of Globalize.formatDate and parseDate methods.
    - Added scaling specifiers to Globalization.formatNumber and parseFloat. For example,
      'n0,' divides the value by one thousand, 'n0,,' by one million, and 'n0,,,' by one 
      billion. The scaling specifiers are especially useful in charts based on large values
      so the axis display scaled values which are easier to read and take up less space.
    - Added a Gauge.thumbSize property that enables displaying a 'thumb' element to show
      the current value at the end of the 'pointer' range. This applies to linear and 
      radial gauges.
    - Added mouse wheel support to editable Gauges.

* Bug fixes
    - Prevented AutoComplete from selecting all the text while the user types.

    - Axis ticks and grid lines rendered properly with overlapped axis labels(TFS 125273).
    - Chart focus events fire correctly in IE(TFS 124275).
    - Candlestick and HighLowOpenClose chart types now support 'rotated' property(TFS 118721).
    - Fixed problem with series visibility toggle when there are hidden series(TFS 110615). 
    - Fixed problem with major and minor grid lines for category x-axis(TFS 110250).
    - Chart updated correctly after changing axis 'reversed' property(TFS 100492).
    - Added angular attribute for axis 'overlappingLabels' property(TFS 98919).

Build Number 5.20151.50          Build Date: 05/07/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved scrolling performance in IE (found out that border-radius on the host

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.42          Build Date: 03/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance.
    - Added markers to indicate the position of rows and columns being dragged.
    - Improved behavior of drop-down grid cells on mobile devices.
    - Added select-all functionality when the user clicks the top-left fixed cell.

      ListBox adds checkboxes to each item, and fires the itemChecked event when
      the current item is checked or unchecked.
    - Deprecated and removed the wijmo.isTouchDevice method. The method
      actually tested the browser, not the device, so it was useless.
    - Added a LineMarker class to the wijmo.chart module that provides FlexChart with a 
      continuous data point information with optional directional lines  
      as mouse pointer moves over a chart surface.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.interaction extension module with a RangeSelector class
      that allows the user to choose the range of data to display on the specified FlexChart.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive for Angular that allows to define
      a custom template for any type of a FlexGrid cell (column and row headers,
      editing cell, and so on).
    - Cell templates now support element level directives.
    - Wijmo child directives for Angular (like WjFlexGridColumn or WjFlexChartSeries),
      when used in conjunction with ng-repeat directive, now support full-functional
      synchronization with ng-repeat's source array, including items order.

    - Fixed rendering of merged cells when there are frozen areas (TFS 110627).
    - Fixed handling of IME text in ComboBox when isEditable = false (TFS 108547).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.39        Build Date: 02/23/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.sortRowIndex property. This property determines the index of 
      the row in the column headers panel that displays the sort icon and can be clicked
      to sort the column. By default, it is set to null, causing the last row in the 
      panel to be the 'sort row.'
    - Raise editing events when pasting data into the FlexGrid (this allows users to
      prevent overwriting of specific cells when pasting).
    - Improved column filters to work with complex properties (e.g. 'state.name', 'state.pop').
    - Exposed wijmo.Binding class used to work with complex properties.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed several problems with rendering mixed chart types (TFS 96721, 98617).
    - Made pie chart handle negative data values correctly (TFS 89936).
    - Fixed a problem with the pie chart tooltip for the selected slice (TFS 108871).
    - Fixed a problem with chart tooltips in IE11 (TFS 109876).
    - Fixed InputMask cursor positioning on Safari (TFS 109969, 102148, 96927).
    - Fixed aggregate so that it updates correctly after adding new rows (TFS 109119).
    - Improved date/time detection in the FlexGridFilter editor (TFS 109409).
    - Prevented users from dragging rows below the new row template (TFS 109012).
    - Fixed RTL layout so that it works properly in Safari (TFS 109371).
    - Fixed cell templates so that they are honored in GroupRows (regression).
    - Fixed a problem with dropdown controls on mobile browsers.
    - Fixed Wijmo directives for Angular so that they work with the ng-inspector tool.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.37        Build Date: 02/15/2015

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.grid.grouppanel module with the GroupPanel control to provide drag&drop
      grouping functionality to the FlexGrid control.
    - Improved the CollectionView sorting logic to place nulls at the bottom of the list,
      regardless of sort direction (Excel behavior).
    - Allow initialization of ObservableArray in constructor.
    - Improved formatting of values in GroupRow node cells.
* Bug fixes
    - The data labels are not visible for data points outside plot area (TFS 109293).
    - Fixed problem with stacked charts when first series has custom chart type (TFS 107530).
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows in grids with word-wrapping and merged columns.
    - Fixed problem with disappearing dropdown controls on mobile devices in case of zoomed in
      pages.
    - Fixed problem with AutoComplete in the Android 4.4.2 Browser where typed characters 
      can be swapped.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.35        Build Date: 02/09/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved the grouping logic of paged CollectionViews to avoid splitting groups
      between pages and to include all items in aggregates (as opposed to items in
      the current page which was the previous behavior; TFS 139570).
    - Added a CollectionView.sortConverter property. The property specifies a function
      that can be used to customize the sorting behavior of the CollectionView.
    - Improved FlexGrid sorting to take dataMaps into account. Now the grid sorts based
      on display value (as opposed to raw data values which was the previous behavior).
    - Expanded grid keyboard handling: now ctrl+home and ctrl+end navigate to the
      first and last cells on the grid (as opposed to home/end, which navigate to the
      first and last cells on the current row).
    - Added Gauge.origin property. This property determines the starting point used
      for painting the pointer range. Setting it to null causes the gauge to use
      the min property or zero if the range extends from negative to positive values.
    - Clamp InputNumber value between min/max as the user types the value in.
    - Improved behavior of input controls on touch devices.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart updating after changing collection (TFS 107253).
    - Fixed problem with FlexPie bound to CollectionView with currentPosition=-1 (TFS 106270).
    - Fixed problem with calculating axis limits in stacked chart with series that has
      custom chart-type (TFS 106988).
    - FlexPie labels rendered correctly when offset > 0 (TFS 105891).
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart axis minor ticks and grid lines (TFS 101264, 101401).
    - FlexChart legend and titles rendered with default text color (TFS 98329).
    - Fixed problem with rendering bubble and financial charts bound to CollectionView.
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid when selectionMode == ListBox and empty item sources.
    - Fixed positioning of grid filter editor on frozen columns (TFS 105593).
    - Fixed problem with merging cells in group rows with aggregates (TFS 98610).
    - Allow clearing cells pressing Delete when column has map and is not required (TFS 107058).
    - Improved positioning of InputDate dropdown calendar (TFS 102162).
    - Fixed regression with dropdowns not showing in iOS Safari.

Build Number 5.20143.25      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added frozenRows and frozenColumns properties to the FlexGrid.
      Frozen cells are non-scrollable (like header cells) but can be selected and 
      edited (like regular cells).
    - Added Axis properties itemsSource, binding, itemFormatter. 
      The properties provide axis label customization.
    - Added Axis overlappingLabels property that controls appearance
      overlapped labels on axis. By default the overlapped labels are hidden.

Build Number 5.20143.24      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added InputColor and ColorPicker controls to wijmo.input module.
    - Added toHsb, toHsl, fromHsb, fromHsl methods to Color class.
    - Improved Globalize.formatNumber to honor the 'd' format as per the .NET spec.
      (e.g. Globalize.formatNumber(-1234, 'D6') == '-001234')
    - Added chart axis minor ticks and grid lines
      ('minorTickMarks', 'minorGrid' props in Axis class).
    - Added wijmo.chart.Axis.origin property
      This property allows to specify axis position inside plot area.
    - Added 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property to Angular directives
      and Knockout Bindings. The property gets a true value and event is triggered after
      the directive has finished initialization of the control with values defined in
      its attributes and child directives.

* Bug fixes
    - CollectionView did not raise itemChanged when removing the current item
      and preserving the current position.

    - Fixed problem with column/bar width when using x-value data(TFS 97589). 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.23      Build Date: 11/25/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Removed Wijmo 5 dependency on jQuery.
        Starting with this version, Wijmo 5 has no dependencies on external libraries.
    - Added wijmo.grid.Column.showDropDown property
        This option adds drop-down buttons to cells.
        Clicking the button brings up a list based on the column's dataMap.
        This feature requires the wijmo.input module.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved handling of star-sized columns in auto-sized grids; previously the grid
      could sometimes leave room on the right for a scrollbar that wasn't there.

* Breaking changes
    - Calling the wijmo.grid.DataMap constructor with an itemsSource but no selectedValuePath
      or displayMemberPath parameters used to create integer keys for the values; now the 
      array values are used both as values and as keys; this is more convenient for creating
      lists of strings that can be used with drop-downs and avoids the creation of arbitrary
      (and meaningless) keys.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.22      Build Date: 11/11/2014
