## Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/new) are the preferred way to communicate with the author and users of PivotTable.js, rather than private email.

* Please remember that this project was built almost entirely in unpaid time, and that all support requests are responded to on a volunteer basis. This means that even if your request is very important to you and you urgently need help, this will likely not translate into urgency for the people responding.
* Please read the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) before creating an issue.
* If you have multiple questions, please create multiple issues.
* Please avoid adding a comment to an existing issue to ask an unrelated question, especially if it's already closed. Instead, create a new issue and refer to the older one if it's related.
* When creating issue to report a problem, please try to provide a replicable test case (code, a set of steps and/or a URL demonstrating the problem) so that others can help you.
* When showing your code, please use *text* rather than screenshots of code!
